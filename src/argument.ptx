    <title>Forming Your Argument</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>All writing is driven by some kind of argument, be it a policy paper attempting to persuade the audience to adopt a certain stance, a lab report presenting the findings of an empirical study, or this sentence (which is arguing that all writing has an argument). As a writer, you have a purpose and an objective; why else would you write something at all? While writing and developing your ideas, it is therefore important to keep in mind why you are writing: to whom and for what purpose? Developing and articulating your argument is a necessary component of the writing process. While the transparency of your argument and the way it is presented may vary based on the discipline, class, professor, and even assignment, here are some basic tools you can use to develop and present your argument in an effective and logical way.</p>

        <title>Elements of an Argument</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>After hours of poring over books and sifting through documents in Collins Library (and many cups of coffee from Diversions cafe), you finally hit upon an idea. The evidence corroborates it, and the logic is sound; your ideas align to form a stance that is at once distinctive and supportable.</p>

                <title>Congrats!</title>
                    <p>You have the beginnings of an argument. But how do you begin to articulate this argument in an effective and logical way? How do you use the evidence or findings to support your argument? How do you address the concerns of potential naysayers? How do you know if your argument is too specific or too broad to be arguable?</p>
                    <p>Developing your argument to fulfill all of these requirements is a difficult process and may even seem insurmountable at times. But don't despair! Here are some basic things that every argument should have, regardless of writing type or discipline.</p>
            </paragraphs>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="main-claim">
            <title>Main Claim: What is the main point you are trying to convey?</title>
            <p>Every argument should be guided by a main point or central message.</p>
            <assemblage>
                <title>Tip</title>
                    <p>If you don't know your main claim, try asking yourself questions like:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>What is my main argument?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>What am I trying to prove or disprove?</q></p></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </assemblage>
            <p>For instance, if you are writing an essay on the influence of caffeine consumption on college students, your main claim, or thesis, might be something like <q>Caffeine consumption has numerous positive benefits for the academic lives of college students.</q> This main claim will then likely be broken down into smaller supporting claims, each of which argues a different part of your main claim. For instance, a possible supporting claim of the statement above might be <q>Caffeine promotes student productivity by binding to adenosine receptors in the brain, preventing tiredness and extending hours of awakeness.</q> Another supporting claim could pose that <q>The consumption of caffeine as a critical facet of campus life creates a shared experience of camaraderie among students which, in turn, facilitates intellectual interaction and interdisciplinary collaboration.</q></p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection>
            <title>Evidence: What proof are you using to support your claims?</title>
            <p>While having a main claim is critical in developing your argument, it is not enough to make an effective argument. You can't just say something is true and assume the audience will accept it unconditionally. You also need to support these claims with evidence that can be used to illustrate or bolster your point. Oftentimes, your evidence will lead you to your central claim<mdash/>let it! However, keep in mind that you will have to demonstrate how this evidence best lends itself to supporting your claim, so it's important to use evidence that is relevant, valid, and clearly supports what you are trying to say. Evidence can come in several different forms, including numerical/empirical data, qualitative observations, ethnographic interviews, theoretical analysis, and prior studies derived from primary source material, scholarly journals, or personal experience.</p>
            <assemblage>
                <title>Tip</title>
                <p>To help you determine how your evidence supports your argument, try asking yourself questions like:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>How does this evidence relate to my main claim?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>How will I use this evidence to illustrate my argument?</q></p></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </assemblage>
            <p>For instance, potential pieces of evidence supporting the argument for the academic benefits of caffeine consumption could be the test scores or grade point averages of caffeine addicts, experiential evidence offered by students who used caffeine to increase productivity, or the chemical reactions occurring in the brain that stimulate thinking and awareness.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection>
            <title>Substantiation: Why does the evidence support your claims?</title>
            <p>So you have a main claim, sub claims, and evidence to support them. Wouldn't this be enough to make a strong argument? Not quite, because you often need something that connects your evidence to the claim.</p>
            <assemblage>
                <title>Tip</title>
                <p>In order to help you figure out how to substantiate your argument, you can ask yourself questions like:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>Why is this evidence important?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>How does this piece of evidence support my claim?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>What connects the evidence to my main argument?</q></p></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </assemblage>
            <p>For instance, you couldn't just say, <q>Caffeine has positive academic benefits for college students</q> and <q>Caffeine promotes thinking and awareness</q> or <q>Caffeine leads to higher test scores</q>; in order to make this argument valid, <em>there must be an implicit assumption that <q>Thinking and awareness and higher test scores are critical to academic success.</q></em> Therefore, in developing your argument, it's helpful to remember that substantiation of the evidence is as important to your argument as the evidence itself.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection>
            <title>Counterpoint: What are the limits of your argument?</title>
                <p>
                No matter how effective or well-laid out an argument may be, it will always have some limitations.</p>
            <assemblage>
                <title>Tip</title>
                <p>To help you identify areas of weakness in your argument, try asking yourself questions like:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>What are the opposing arguments?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>Why are these counterpoints valid?</q></p></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </assemblage>
            <p>For instance, a naysayer of the caffeine argument may bring up the potential negative health effects of caffeine addiction, which may lead to poorer student health and therefore poorer academic success. <em>Rather than covering up these counterpoints or uncertainties and pretending they don't exist, strong arguments confront potential naysayers head-on.</em> By acknowledging areas of weakness in your argument, you actually strengthen your claim by setting yourself up to address and respond to other points of view. For instance, you might address the concerns of caffeine addiction by describing some of the negative health effects of caffeine dependence, such as sleep deprivation and withdrawal symptoms when caffeine is unavailable. You might even acknowledge that caffeine dependence may impact student academic success in the short term by promoting procrastination and enabling a series of all-nighters as compensation. However, you can also weaken and overturn these opposing arguments by asking yourself why your argument outweighs its counterpoints.</p>
            <p>
                To help you determine how your argument might respond to opposing views, ask yourself questions like:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>Why does my argument still hold true despite these counterpoints?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>Why do these counterpoints fall short of invalidating my argument?</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><q>How might these counterpoints actually strengthen my own argument?</q></p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>For instance, the writer of the caffeine argument may both acknowledge and disable opposing viewpoints through the proposal that <q>While caffeine dependence may lead to some negative health effects, the ultimate academic benefits resulting from increased productivity outweigh the immediate impacts on student health and behavior.</q> This statement would then be followed by counterevidence displaying why the long term academic benefits of caffeine outweigh the negative health effects, and perhaps even how any negative health effects may actually generate academic success by spurring student performance and productivity.</p>
            <p>After considering counterpoints, you may end up deciding that the counterpoints are more persuasive than your original point. That's okay! It's a sign of intellectual growth when you are able to reconsider your original views on the basis of further research. Just be sure to revise your paper so that the new argument is cohesive.</p>

        <title>Diversity of Argumentation Modes</title>
        <subsection>
            <title>Different Models of Argumentation</title>
            <p>While there are many different forms of argumentation, the four basic parts described above (main claim, evidence, substantiation, counterpoint) are key elements of many argumentative forms. However, these components can be interpreted differently in different disciplines (see <xref ref="discipline-specific-writing"/>) and for different assignments. For instance, the argument of a definitional or informational essay will employ language distinct from that of a scientific or philosophical study. A preferred argumentation form for your professor may not include language such as <q>main claim, evidence, substantiation, and counterpoint,</q> but may employ similar components that do similar things.</p>
            <p>Similarly, there are many different models for structuring your argument. Some disciplines and professors use the <term>Toulmin model</term> of argumentation, which prioritizes evidence, claim, and warrants as the most critical parts of an argument. Others prefer the <term>classical approach</term>, which requires you to propose a certain stance, refute the opposing view, and offer proof to substantiate your claim. Still others may prefer you use the <term>Rogerian model</term>, which promotes a more neutral and compromising view of both sides of an argument. Unless a preference is indicated by your professor, use the model that makes the most sense for your assignment and argument. In fact, many writers use a hybrid between the different types while organizing their argument, using parts from each of them.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you are writing an essay arguing whether coffee or tea is a better study stimulant for college students. You may use the Rogerian model to provide equal experiential evidence from people who drink coffee and people who drink tea, Toulmin's data-driven analysis to argue that coffee people receive higher test grades, and then the classical approach to refute the argument that tea is a better study stimulant and substantiate your case for coffee. Mix it up!</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="argumentation-as-process">
            <title>Argumentation as Process</title>
            <p>Argumentation is not static or linear; rather, it is a dynamic conversation between you and scholars who have preceded you. Regardless of the language and argumentation model you ultimately decide to use, it's important to keep in mind that the argumentative process is just that: a process of discovering, responding to, and contributing to existing knowledge. Your plan should be first to identify what others are saying and then to figure out a way to respond to them that keeps the scholarly conversation going. Who knows? Perhaps one day other scholars may even respond and contribute to your own argument.</p>

        <title>Making a Strong Argument</title>
        <p>Having the basic elements of an argument (main claim, evidence, substantiation, and counterpoint) is important, but that's not all you can do to make your argument as strong as possible. The most effective arguments are specific, meaningful, arguable within the scope of the assignment, supported by firm lines of evidence, and contestable. While you are developing your argument, use the following questions to help you frame and strengthen it further.</p>
        <list>
            <paragraphs><title>Argument Checklist</title>
            <dl>
                <li>
                    <title>Is it too broad/specific?</title>
                    <p>Arguments often start out broad in scope and then narrow as more and more evidence is collected. The trick is making sure an argument doesn't stay too broad or become so narrow that it no longer becomes arguable. For instance, the argument <q>Rain influences people's behavior</q> would be daunting to research and argue because people likely respond to rain in a number of different ways. On the other hand, the argument <q>Rain influences the walking rates of Puget Sound students in Tacoma, Washington, differently between the months of January and February</q> might be too specific a topic to gather substantive research on or make a meaningful claim about. Consider instead the argument <q>Rain has both positive and negative effects on students<rsq/> physical and emotional well-being.</q> This statement is both researchable and takes a clear stance about the influence of rain on student behavior.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Is it arguable based on the available evidence?</title>
                    <p>In order to make a strong argument, you generally need a substantial amount of strong evidence to back it up. But let's say you want to write about the negative effects of rainfall on the emotional well-being of Puget Sound students. You go to <url href="https://pugetsound.edu/library">Collins Library</url>, visit a liaison librarian, look through the shelves, skim around in Summit, and even peek into the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/collins-memorial-library/archives/">archives</url>, but the only thing you can find is a couple of articles published in <em>The Trail</em> in the early 2000s. This probably won't be enough to substantiate your claim. Instead, you might try refining your argument to the negative effects of rainfall on the emotional well-being of college students in general. Suddenly, a mass of published scholarly sources on the subject appear on the Collins Library search engine. Hooray! You may now have enough evidence to substantiate your argument<mdash/>and you'll be creating new knowledge by considering how the general research applies in your particular context.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Does the evidence support it?</title>
                    <p>You also need to make sure the evidence available supports your argument. It's important to listen to your evidence and let it point you in the direction of your argument rather than the other way around. For instance, if all of the evidence points toward the argument that <q>Rainfall promotes student productivity,</q> you likely wouldn't argue the opposite (that <q>Rainfall reduces student productivity</q>). It's also important to remember to use your evidence wisely. For example, if you find a piece of evidence showing that more students study in Collins Library during periods of heavy rainfall, it would be unwise to use this evidence to argue that students do not study in the library when it is nice outside. Let the evidence lead the way.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Is it contestable?</title>
                    <p>A strong argument should be debatable and challenged by other viewpoints. The strength of your argument actually stems from how well you address these opposing views. For instance, if you were to argue that <q>Rain is condensed moisture falling from the sky,</q> there would be little room for debate because you are arguing a widely accepted fact. However, if you were to argue that <q>Students tend to focus more on homework assignments when it is raining,</q> those who feel that rain lessens productivity by motivating students to crawl into their warm beds might disagree.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Does it offer something new to the existing literature?</title>
                    <p>One of the greatest challenges in developing your argument is making it unique and discernible from the arguments of previous studies or literature. Your argument should not be a mere rehashing of someone else's opinion or conclusions but should rather use these findings as evidence to support your own claim about a topic. It's also helpful if your argument is interesting enough to hold your attention throughout the research and writing process; otherwise, you may find yourself bored a few pages into the assignment! For instance, the above argument <q>Rain is condensed moisture falling from the sky</q> would be pretty boring to write about and has already been supported by numerous scientific studies. In contrast, the alternative argument <q>Students tend to focus more on homework assignments when it is raining</q> is interesting, takes a stance on a certain topic, and is likely less well-supported than the previous statement. It's your argument, so own it!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Does it respond to the prompt/assignment?</title>
                    <p>Even if you have a brilliant argument, it's important to remember that it needs to respond to your prompt or assignment (see <xref ref="how-to-read-writing-prompts"/>). If the prompt asked you to <q>assess the influence of rainfall on student academic productivity,</q> you likely wouldn't argue that <q>the weather during a prospective student's campus tour influences their decision to attend Puget Sound.</q> Some professors are more particular about their assignment prompts or rubrics than others and may have specific guidelines or requirements that you will need to take into account as you construct your argument. In situations when you notice that your argument has shifted away from the prompt, resist the feeling that you must stifle your argument to <q>fit the requirements</q>; try to perceive those situations as opportunities to articulate your argument in a way that both satisfies the assignment and preserves your voice. One way to do this is to imagine your argument as an open dialogue with your professor rather than simply a response to a prompt.</p>

        <title>Developing a Thesis</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>So you've been given a writing assignment. You've read <xref ref="how-to-read-writing-prompts"/> on how to read writing prompts, and you've begun thinking about the components of a good argument, but now what? In order to structure your paper effectively and to know what supporting claims it needs, you need to have a <term>main claim</term> or <term>thesis</term>. A thesis is an argumentative, contestable statement that tells an audience exactly what a writer intends to argue (for more information, see <xref ref="the-bubble-map"/>).</p>
            <sidebyside width="50%">
                <image source="images/AD-Car"/>
            </sidebyside>
            <p>The thesis is thus the main point of your paper. Writing a paper without a thesis is like trying to drive a car without tires; the body will be there, but you certainly won't be taking your reader anywhere important. Good theses do everything good tires should do: they get you moving smoothly, give you traction, and make your arguments a lot more appealing and convincing to audiences. It's difficult to start writing without a working thesis, but once you have an idea of your main argument, you'll be writing in no time. The thesis also provides you with the foundation of and traction for your argument. If you ever find yourself asking, <q>Wait, what am I even writing about?</q> you can refer back to your thesis. Alternatively, you might realize that what you're saying doesn't align with your thesis, so you might rewrite your thesis<mdash/>change your tires<mdash/>altogether! Finally, a good, thorough thesis indicates to the audience that you are an authoritative and careful writer, one who establishes an argument outright and has evidence to support it. Just like a car without tires, a paper without a thesis is odd and ineffective.</p>
            <p>As a scholar in training, your theses represent your contributions to the broader academic conversations in which they take part. Just as with spoken conversations, you don't want the contributions you make to scholarly conversations to be repetitions of what other people have said. Your thesis must therefore be a new, interesting idea that you've come up with. While this endeavor sounds near impossible<mdash/>how can I, as a mere scholar in training, contribute to a conversation with professional and practiced scholars?<mdash/>you needn't worry. You don't have to make a life-changing contribution, and you surely don't need to know every argument that has ever been made on your topic. What you <em>do</em> need to do is develop a research question, research that question, and form a thesis that crystallizes your ideas and findings. Although your paper may be simply another writing assignment that you hope to finish and forget, you might consider thinking about your thesis as an opportunity to develop an idea that legitimately falls within a scholarly conversation.</p>

            </sidebyside>
            <p>Now, how do you go about writing your thesis? Since your thesis is the main point of your argument, you may find it difficult and time consuming to construct the perfect sentence (or two!). Strategies to develop your thesis are therefore very important. Let's start from the beginning.</p>
            <p>A note before we begin: It is important that you write down <em>every version</em> of your thesis. You don't want to have a brilliant idea only to forget it five minutes later; sometimes old versions of your thesis can be useful in crafting newer versions.</p>

        <subsection>
            <title>Six-Step Process</title>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Step 1: Articulate your idea</title>
                <p>Your idea will most likely be guided by your class, professor, or assignment. You may have a range of topics or prompts to choose from, so think through each option carefully and determine which idea interests you most.</p>
                <p>Let's say that you choose a prompt directing you to argue for or against this statement: <q>I should be able to own as many cats as I want.</q> You're interested in learning more about why cat ownership shouldn't be regulated, so your idea is to argue in favor of the statement.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Step 2: Gather knowledge</title>
                <p>In order to make any kind of claim about your idea, you must first gather information on your topic. This knowledge can come in a variety of forms, including textual analysis, data gathering, or scholarly research. Your discipline or assignment will probably dictate what type of knowledge you need to gather. If in doubt, ask your professor.</p>
                <p>For your cat assignment, let's say that the knowledge you need to gather will come from scholarly journals. After scouring all of the top academic cat journals, you compile a number of sources that describe the woes of rampant cat homelessness. You find other sources that argue that cats should be bought and sold like consumer goods. As you learn from more reading, the ability to purchase consumer goods is something Americans value as a right.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Step 3: Identify a pattern</title>
                <p>Patterns in your research can come in many forms. You might find a topic or argument that is repeatedly in conflict with another topic or argument, a source that provides an unexpected argument, or a new way to combine arguments or ideas.</p>
                <p>In your cat-journal research, you find that cat homelessness is a major problem throughout the world. You also realize that you can combine the first argument, that cats should be bought like consumer goods, and the second argument, that Americans value purchasing consumer goods as a right.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Step 4: Formulate a question that responds to the prompt</title>
                <p>Now you must think about your research and idea in the context of your assignment. Your question will vary depending on the format of the prompt. If the prompt itself is a question, your question might be a more specific version of the prompt. If the prompt offers up ideas or guidelines, then your question will need to adhere to those ideas or guidelines. Regardless of the format, your question will most likely ask for explanations about why, what about, or how your evidence relates to your claim.</p>
                <p>Recall the prompt: Argue for or against the statement <q>I should be able to own as many cats as I want.</q></p>
                <p>You come up with the question: <q>Why should I be able to purchase as many cats as I want?</q></p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Step 5: Listen to the evidence</title>
                <p>The evidence will guide you to your claim<mdash/>let it! While it may be tempting to pick and choose evidence that supports the claim that you want to make, strong academic argumentation requires researchers to make claims validated and substantiated by a fair and thorough examination of the available evidence. By listening to the evidence, you ensure that your claim answers your question honestly and opens a dialogue with which other researchers can engage.</p>

                <title>Step 6: Develop a working thesis</title>
                <p>The claim you devised in Step 5 will become your working thesis. A working thesis is the initial thesis you come up with, and it will guide your subsequent research. That research will, in turn, help you reformulate your working thesis as your research changes and your understanding of your topic, evidence, and main claim shifts. Your research isn't done when you formulate your working thesis, so keep researching and rewriting!</p>

            <p>Sometimes, one sentence isn't enough space to contain all of these things. If your thesis has depth and complexity, you likely will find yourself needing two or three sentences, or even a small paragraph, to fully explicate your thesis. Take this space and make it yours! However, if you find your thesis is taking up paragraphs, this may be an indication that you need to pare it down to make it more manageable.

            <p>Consider the following example theses from Puget Sound student papers. In what ways do they or do they not do <acro>MORE</acro>?</p>
            <example>
                <p>While women do have a substantial presence in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the characters of Helen, Penelope, and Athena reify patriarchal norms regarding the role of the feminine in society by positing themselves below the authority and sovereignty of male characters. Coupled with the epic's clear celebration of warfare, the <em>Odyssey</em> primarily reinforces the chauvinist framework through which we view the world.</p>
            </example>
            <example>
                <p>The relationship between the two debates was forged by the underlying theme concerning access to the government; universal male suffrage was a microcosm of the tension between the principle of majoritarianism and the preservation of minority rights concerning their places within the government. This question would significantly shape the political discourse in the United States for much of the nineteenth century.</p>
            </example>
            <example>
                <p>The Immigration Act of 1965 effectively restructured the United States' immigration policies in such a way that no group, minority or majority, was singled out by being discriminated against or given preferential treatment in terms of its ability to immigrate to America.</p>
            </example>
            <example>
                <p>In an excerpt from his book <pubtitle>The Will to Believe</pubtitle>, James successfully disproves Clifford's argument, explained in his article <q>The Ethics of Belief,</q> revealing that, under certain circumstances, it's moral and rational to believe something without evidence.</p>

    <section>
        <title>Organization of an Argument</title>
        <p>At this point in the development of your argument, you should have a working thesis and multiple supporting claims. Now you must think about your argument from the point of view of your audience. Arguments must be organized in a way that audiences can logically follow. Your main goal as a writer is to organize your argument logically and convincingly enough that a reader will be persuaded by what you've written. Because argument organization varies between papers and subjects, you need to figure out what your audience will need and want while reading through your argument.</p>
        <assemblage>
            <title>Tip</title>
            <p>
            Consider asking yourself these questions:
            <ul>
                <li><p><q>What pieces of your argument does an audience need in order to make sense of the following parts?</q></p></li>
                <li><p><q>Do the pieces of your argument need to build on each other in a certain way?</q></p></li>
                <li><p><q>Should you organize your supporting claims chronologically? By order of importance?</q></p></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </assemblage>
            <p>Now, to answer these questions, you have a few options:
            <ul>
                <li><p>Make a few different outlines (see <xref ref="planning"/>).</p></li>
                <li><p>Write your supporting claims on notecards and organize them a few different ways.</p></li>
                <li><p>Map out your ideas by drawing connections between your claim, supporting claims, and evidence.</p></li>
                <li><p>Talk through your argument with someone, perhaps a writing advisor at the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/cwlt/writing-advisor-schedule">Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching</url>! (It might also be helpful to take notes during/record the conversation so you have content from the conversation to use as you return to writing and organizing.)</p></li>
                <li><p>Ask yourself, <q>Which one seems the most logical?</q></p></li>
                <li><p>Ask a friend or peer to look at your organizational schemes to see what he or she thinks is most logical.</p></li>

        <title>Using Evidence to Support an Argument</title>
        <p>To be convincing, an argument must have compelling evidence linked and supported with clear analysis. Strong arguments are thoroughly reasoned and continuous in their analysis of evidence, which is sometimes challenging, but it helps to keep a few principles in mind: Notice-Think-Write and the Quote Sandwich.</p>
        <p>Consider the following construction, which is neither thoroughly reasoned nor continuous:</p>

Though they are in the same geographic space, Adele and her addressee are separated on a nonspatial level by an otherworldly emotional distance.</p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>Okay, what the Grizz is going on? Though the intuitive reader may be able to follow the writer's logic, this argument lacks the analysis necessary to explicitly connect the evidence to the claim; because it lacks this analysis, the argument is not as convincing as it could be. How can the writer better analyze the text to make their point? Let's consider the following three-step principle.</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>1. Notice</title>
            <p>Effective analysis identifies the specific elements of the evidence that point to the claim being made.</p>
            <p>Look over the lyrics to Adele's <q>Hello.</q> Notice anything that stands out to you and anything you think might be meaningful for the song. Pay attention to language, syntax (sentence structure), logic, and other formal or thematic aspects. For instance, I might think that when Adele sings <q>a million miles</q> she's exaggerating just a little.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>2. Think</title>
            <p>Effective analysis is predicated on <q>how</q> and <q>why</q> questions. Ask yourself these types of questions to move from the realm of identifying to that of speculating.</p>
            <p>Let's think about some things that we noticed: What do these rhetorical, aesthetic, logical, or formal choices mean, or how do they contribute to the meaning of the text? Pay attention to how form and content intersect. For example, I might look at the phrase <q>a million miles</q> and think that, since the earth is only 8,000 miles in diameter, Adele's longing for this person is otherworldly, or exceeds the bounds of earthly description.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The song tells us that Adele's in California and that the person she's addressing is <q>a million miles away.</q> I wonder: What's a million miles away from California? I Google the earth's diameter and find that it's roughly 8,000 miles in diameter. I do some math to determine where a million miles from California is. But one million divided by 8,000 comes out evenly<mdash/>125. So Adele's addressee is in California as well, or at least in the area. Then I think, Adele is referring to the distance and not the displacement between herself and her addressee. Thus, though the displacement between Adele and her addressee is 0, the figural distance between them is equal to eight times the earth's diameter. The phrase <q>a million miles</q> then encodes, ironically, that, though they are close to each other geographically, Adele and her addressee are separated on a nonspatial level by an otherworldly emotional distance.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="Adele-quote-sandwich">
            <title>3. Write</title>
            <p>Now that you've thought about the things you noticed, put your thoughts into words. It can be helpful to speak your thought process while you're writing, just to be as specific as possible.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><green>In <q>Hello,</q> Adele's use of hyperbole reveals the otherworldly intensity of her longing; she sings,</green> <darkred><q>I'm in California dreaming<nbsp/><ellipsis/><nbsp/>/<nbsp/><ellipsis/><nbsp/>/ There's such a difference between us / And a million miles</q> (10-11).</darkred> <darkpurple>The phrase <q>a million miles</q> is an exaggerated estimation of the distance between Adele and the person whom she addresses. The use of <q>California</q> as a geographical marker suggests that the person Adele is addressing is a million miles away from California. However, the earth is only 8,000 miles in diameter. One million divided by 8,000 is 125 with no remainder. Assuming the person Adele is addressing is also somewhere on earth, the <q>million miles</q> between Adele and her addressee actually locates the addressee in California. <q>A million miles</q> must then refer to a distance, as opposed to a displacement, suggesting that though the displacement between Adele and her addressee is 0, the figural distance between them is equal to 125 times the earth's diameter. The phrase <q>a million miles</q> then encodes, ironically, that, though they are in the same geographic space, Adele and her addressee are separated on a nonspatial level by an otherworldly emotional distance.</darkpurple></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>(You'll want to make your thought process as transparent as possible so that others can respond to your argument. For instance, someone could respond to the above argument by saying that a person could travel a million miles in a nonlinear fashion such that Adele and her addressee could as likely be 4,000 miles apart as they are 0 miles apart.)</p>
            <p>And you're done! By following this simple, three-step process, the writer comes up with a coherent and thoroughly reasoned analysis that connects evidence to claim in a convincing way.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <p>Take some time to practice the above strategies on your own. When you're done, take a quick break and watch everyone's favorite nature video personality, Sir David Attenborough, narrate the beginning of the <q>Hello</q> music video.</p>

        <title>Using Quote Sandwiches</title>
            <p>Formally speaking, there are certain conventions that academics like to follow when dealing with evidence. For instance, it is considered inelegant to use advice without introducing it first. Luckily, you just need to keep in mind the <term>quote sandwich</term>, and you'll never make that inelegant mistake.</p>
            <p>
                The quote sandwich is nothing more than a three-part organizational template that consists of the following parts:
                <ul>
                    <li>The upper bun of your quote sandwich introduces the quotation under consideration with information about its author and source and with the claim that you're making about it.</li>
                    <li>The meat, or non meat substitute, of your sandwich consists of your quote with a proper in-text citation.</li>
                    <li>The bottom bun of your sandwich consists of your thorough analysis of the evidence.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>You may have noticed that the written analysis (see <xref ref="Adele-quote-sandwich" text="title"/>) in the previous section was rendered in three different colors. These colors represent different parts of the quote sandwich. The clause in green introduces the quotation that follows it and anticipates the argument that will be made about the evidence in the section in purple. The text in red is the quotation introduced by the clause in green and commented on by the text in purple. The text in purple analyzes the text in red and elaborates on the claim forecasted by the text in green.</p>
            <p>Quote sandwiches are exceedingly accessible (and tasteful!) ways to structure your in-paragraph arguments.</p>
