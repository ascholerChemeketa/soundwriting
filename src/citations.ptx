    <title>Citations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>We'll just go ahead and say it: citations are a pain. While everyone agrees that clear references to the sources you use are essential to good scholarship, almost no one likes actually keeping track of and writing out citations. But, alas, they must be done! We hope that this section will enable you to think about citations in a new way, one less about memorizing styles and more about understanding the conceptual and practical foundations of citing sources.</p>

        <title>The Basics</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>When writing citations, the most basic question you need to ask yourself is, <q>What information would someone need to find this source on their own?</q> Although nowadays you'd likely use your phone to take a picture of a product you want to be able to find again (your favorite brand of bread, for example), citations require a little more effort. The basic principle, however, is the same. When taking a picture to remember something, you make sure that you have the name and any other identifying information that will help you find it again. Similarly, when writing a citation, you want to make sure you include the basic identifying features of a source, namely the author, title, date, and publisher.</p>
            <p>Citations serve many purposes. Beyond allowing others to <em>find</em> the sources you use, citations also give your audience clues about the type of information you've used, where that information came from, and how reliable the information is within a particular context, all without having to go find the source directly. There are two main categories of each citation style: in<ndash/>text citations and full citations. In<ndash/>text citations provide a reader with immediate information about the source from which a piece of information came. Full citations provide a reader with more complete information about the source.</p>

            <title>Background</title>
            <p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the three major citation styles you'll encounter during your time at Puget Sound: <init>MLA</init> (Modern Language Association), <init>CMS</init> (Chicago Manual of Style), and <init>APA</init> (American Psychological Association).</p>
            <p>In general, here are some differences between the styles:</p>

                <p>Having trouble finding the right information in a source? Things like publishing location can sometimes be tricky to pinpoint. If you've looked all over the copyright page, title page, binding, and cover, just go to Google and search the publisher's name. You'll likely find the publisher's address, which should tell you what city the company is located in. Another trick is to look the book up on <url href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon<fn><c>amazon.com</c></fn></url><mdash/>sometimes they'll have the right information in the <q>Product Details</q> section.</p>

            <title>In<ndash/>Text Citations</title>
            <p>For citation styles that include citations in parenthesis in the body of your paper (also known as parenthetic citations), it's crucial that the in<ndash />text citation (the part in your paper that's in parenthesis) corresponds exactly with the full reference at the end of the paper in the Works Cited or References section. But parenthetic citations are also designed to offer information with minimal disruption to the reader's engagement with the text; if some of the citation information is in the sentence itself, then there's no need to repeat the information in the parenthesis.</p>

                <title>Strategies for Writing Parenthetical Citations</title>
                <introduction>
                    <p>The citations in this list are <init>MLA</init> format, but the general principles apply in parenthetic formats such as <init>APA</init> and Chicago Author Date format (the Chicago formatting style that doesn’t use footnotes).</p>

        <title>Avoiding Plagiarism</title>
        <p>Plagiarism is unethical and has serious repercussions at the University of Puget Sound. As the <pubtitle><init>MLA</init> Handbook</pubtitle> (8th Edition) reads, <q>Plagiarism is presenting another person's ideas, information, expressions, or entire work as one's own</q> (6<ndash/>7). If I hadn't cited the <pubtitle><init>MLA</init> Handbook</pubtitle> just now and had presented the sentence as my own, I would have plagiarized and would have been fired. This is why citing is important and why professionals place so much emphasis on academic integrity. Below are some pointers on how to avoid plagiarism.</p>
        <p>Because plagiarism is the act of claiming another's intellectual output as your own, plagiarism includes more than not quoting text that ought to be quoted; plagiarism also includes not attributing authorship to ideas that are not originally yours and framing as your own a paper that someone else wrote (even if you paid them). It is also considered plagiarism to reuse an essay that you had previously written. The University of Puget Sound has a policy forbidding the reuse of previous work without express permission from your instructor.</p>
        <p>For more information on Puget Sound policies on plagiarism, please see the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/student-life/personal-safety/student-handbook/academic-handbook/">Puget Sound Academic Handbook</url>.</p>
        <p>Plagiarism is hardly ever intended. More often, a student who plagiarizes will be unaware that they are doing so. Here are some suggestions to help you avoid plagiarizing.</p>
        <list xml:id="list-citations-avoiding-plagiarism">
            <title>Strategies for Avoiding Plagiarism</title>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Write down everything.</em></p>
                    <p>When you're doing research, keep track of all of your sources, especially sources from which you quote or paraphrase. If you're drafting and don't want to break your focus, leave a comment to remind yourself to cite the source later. (A knowledge<ndash/>management tool such as Zotero can help you to keep track of your sources.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Attribute everything.</em></p>
                    <p>The most important thing to include when attributing authorship is the author's name. This can be done in text, in parentheses, or in a note. If the source does not name an author, provide the title of the source. It is also useful to provide page or line numbers whenever possible. It is safest and often most effective rhetorically to credit the author or source as near to the attributed material as possible; attribution should occur within the same sentence as the attributed material. (For information about the conventions of attribution, both textual and parenthetical, see <xref ref="the-basics"/>.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>When in doubt, quote.</em></p>
                    <p>Paraphrasing presents problems for students, primarily because the line between acceptable paraphrase and plagiarism is somewhat arbitrary. Of course, this shouldn't be a problem if you attribute the paraphrased information to its original author(s). Though disciplines and styles have different preferences, the transparency of quoting makes it a safe way to present information that isn't your own. Quoting, however, should never take the place of attributing authorship.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Not everything needs a citation.</em></p>
                    <p>Any knowledge that both you and your readers share need not be cited. For instance, it is probably safe to assume that your readers will know that plagiarism is unethical. You could make such a statement without feeling the need to attribute it. However, it would be necessary to attribute authorship to a statement suggesting that plagiarism is ethical<mdash/>for such an idea is not likely to be shared by your readers. That said, when in doubt, attribute. There's little, if anything, wrong with attributing too much, while attributing too little can be disastrous. It is in your best interest to cite.</p>
