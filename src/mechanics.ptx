    <title>Writing at the Sentence Level</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>Although some people are willing to express their undying love for grammar via sonnet, most people find sentence-level mechanics daunting, overwhelming, confusing, and sometimes (gasp!) boring. Just the sight of sentence diagrams sends some people straight back to their seventh-grade English class and provokes tears of frustration. There are multitudes of components, hordes of definitions, and seemingly endless numbers of terms. How can anyone keep them all straight?!</p>
        <p>Fear not. The good news is that you've had a miraculous understanding of English grammar (or the grammar of whatever your first language may be) since the time you learned to ask for more Cheerios. Your babbles as a baby, simple sentences as a toddler, and recent rap battles with friends have all prepared you to understand, work with, and manipulate language in complicated and ingenious ways. You're already so cool!</p>

        <introduction>
            <p>The purpose of this section is to help elucidate why you can understand the sentence you're currently reading (What parts does it contain? What do those parts mean?). We hope to lay out completely yet concisely all of the sentence-level basics with which you should be familiar. Let's get started (don't worry<mdash/>we'll ease into it)!</p>

            <title>Parts of Speech</title>
            <p>Each word in a sentence belongs to a part of speech. There are eight parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. Words can belong to multiple parts of speech, depending on how they're being used. By being able to identify the part of speech a word falls into, you can better understand the underlying forms and meanings of a sentence.</p>

            <title>Basic Sentence Structure</title>
            <subsubsection xml:id="subject-predicate">
                <title>Subject-Predicate</title>
                <p>In <xref ref="SAE" text="title"/> (<init>SAE</init>), a basic sentence is composed of two parts: the subject and the predicate. The <term>subject</term> of a sentence is the person or entity that does an action or is the main focus of the sentence. The subject may be a noun, proper noun, personal pronoun, noun phrase, or different nouns linked by a conjunction. The <term>predicate</term> is the action or description of the subject. Predicates may be verbs, verbs accompanied by helping verbs, or an entire verb phrase. For instance, in the sentence <q>The first-year student waited in line for the Farm-to-Table special,</q> the noun phrase <q>the first-year student</q> would be the subject and <q>waited in line for the Farm-to-Table special</q> would be the predicate. An easy way to distinguish the subject and predicate of a sentence is to 1) ask yourself what is <q>being done</q> (predicate), and then 2) ask yourself <q>what</q> is doing that action (subject).</p>
                <p>
                    Below you can find a few example sentences showing the subject and predicate (the subject is italicized and the predicate is in regular typeface):
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><em>Ollie</em> studied in Diversions.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>The IPE professor</em> told the class to turn the assignment in on Moodle.</p></li>
                        <li><p><em>The a capella group <q>What She Said</q></em> will perform at the spring concert.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </subsubsection>
            <subsubsection xml:id="direct-indirect-objects">
                <title>Direct and Indirect Objects</title>
                <p>A complete sentence always has a subject and a predicate (see <xref ref="subject-predicate" text="title"/>). A predicate can include both direct and indirect objects.</p>
                <p>A direct object is the noun on which the action occurs. In the sentence, <q>You bought a present,</q> <em><q>the present</q></em> is the direct object because it is the noun on which the action <em><q>bought</q></em> occurs.</p>
                <p>An indirect object is the secondary object, or the object secondarily affected by the action, which is to say that a sentence can only have an indirect object if it also has a direct object. An indirect object is either explicitly or implicitly prepositional. In the sentence, <q>You bought a present for me,</q> <em><q>me</q></em> is the indirect object because it is the recipient of the object originally acted on. In this case, it is marked by the preposition <em><q>for.</q></em> The sentence could also be constructed <q>You bought me a present.</q> Here, the direct and indirect objects are the same, only the indirect object is not indicated by the preposition <em><q>for.</q></em> An easy way to identify the direct and indirect object of a sentence is to ask yourself: On what is the action occurring? (This is the direct object.) And what is being affected by the action having already occurred on something else? (This is the indirect object.)</p>

                <title>Clauses</title>
                <p>What do clauses and amino acids have in common? They're both essential building blocks! Just as amino acids make life possible, clauses make sentences possible. As you read in the previous section, every clause is composed of a <term>subject</term> and a <term>predicate</term>, <em>which also means that every clause has a noun and a verb</em>. Unfortunately, like many things in English, there are far too many terms that make it difficult to keep the concepts straight.</p>
                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Recall</title>
                    <p>The subject is the thing or person a sentence is about. The predicate is the part of a sentence that modifies (<ie/>, tells you what's going on with) the subject. The predicate also contains a verb and sometimes a direct or an indirect object or different kinds of phrases.</p>

                    <title>Independent/Main</title>
                    <p>An independent clause, also called a main clause, has a subject and a verb and conveys a complete thought.</p>

                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Subordinate/Dependent</title>
                    <p>The primary feature of subordinate/dependent clauses is that they cannot stand alone because they do not form a complete thought. Subordinate/dependent clauses are dependent on an independent clause to make sense.</p>

                <title>Phrases</title>
                <p>Phrases are to sentences what landscaping is to Puget Sound. Just as Puget Sound's landscaping makes the campus beautiful, interesting, and informative, so too do phrases add beauty, interest, and information to sentences. Like clauses and almost everything else grammar related, though, there are far too many phrases with overly confusing names. To remember and understand each type of phrase, it might be helpful for you to review the parts of speech. Since phrases function as single parts of speech, you can figure out which type of phrase a particular phrase is by identifying its role in a sentence.</p>
                <assemblage>
                    <p>Whereas a clause has both a noun <em>and</em> a verb, a phrase has either a noun <em>or</em> a verb, but <em>not both</em>. Phrases are groups of words that function as a single part of speech (<eg/>, a noun or an adjective).</p>

                    <p>are words, phrases, or clauses that characterize a noun and are typically used to add description or specificity to a sentence. You can identify the modifier in a sentence by asking yourself which or what kind of noun the sentence is highlighting. For example, in the sentence <q>The students gazed in awe at the towering sequoia tree,</q> the word <q>towering</q> is being used to modify or describe the sequoia tree. Therefore, to identify the modifier, you can ask yourself <q>Which sequoia tree?</q> and answer <q>The towering one.</q></p>

                    <p>can also act as modifiers. For instance, in the sentence <q>Gazing at the towering sequoia tree, the students were in awe,</q> the phrase <q>gazing at the towering sequoia tree</q> is the modifier describing the students. You can play the same game as before: <q>Which students were in awe?</q> <q>The ones gazing at the towering sequoia tree.</q></p>

In the sentence <q>The sequoia tree, which was towering over the students, inspired widespread awe,</q> the clause <q>which was towering over the students</q> is the modifier describing the sequoia tree. Again: <q>What kind of sequoia tree?</q> <q>The one towering over the students.</q></p>

                <title>Subordination and Coordination</title>
                <p>Because both clauses in a compound sentence are independent, neither one is obviously backgrounded in relation to the other (as in a complex sentence). That's because the relation between the clauses of a compound sentence is only conveyed lexically (through the coordinating conjunction), as opposed to lexically and syntactically (in a complex sentence). Nonetheless, a compound sentence can serve various purposes. A compound sentence that conjoins clauses using <em><q>and</q></em> can provide extra information (<q>I want to go to the park and I want to search for Pokemon</q>). A compound sentence that conjoins clauses using <em><q>or</q></em> or <em><q>nor</q></em> can provide alternatives (<q>I want to go to the park or I want to stay home and play Pokemon</q>). A compound sentence that conjoins clauses using <em><q>so</q></em> or <em><q>for</q></em> can provide justification (<q>I want to go to the park so I can search for Pokemon; I want to go to the park for I love to search for Pokemon</q>).</p>
                <p>As its name implies, a subordinate clause must always be subordinated to the independent clause in a complex sentence. The effect of this subordination is the backgrounding of the subordinate clause and the foregrounding of the independent clause. In the example <q>When the <acro>SUB</acro> runs out of hummus, I want to cry,</q> the subordinate clause <q>When the <acro>SUB</acro> runs out of hummus</q> is backgrounded in relation to the independent clause <q>I want to cry.</q> This relativization places different emphasis on the clauses. The independent clause <q>I want to cry</q> is more important than the subordinate clause <q>When the <acro>SUB</acro> runs out of hummus</q> because it conveys a complete thought, while the subordinate clause only modifies that thought. As the backgrounded clause, the subordinate clause specifies the context (provides the background) of the independent clause. The picture would be coherent without the background, but not nearly as robust. When constructing a complex sentence, then, consider what the most important part of that sentence is and foreground it.</p>
                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Note</title>
                    <p>Compound sentences are easily transformed into complex sentences. For instance, the example <q>I miss my high school friends, but I'm excited to make new friends.</q> could be reconstructed to read <q>Although I miss my high school friends, I'm excited to make new friends.</q> Consider what meaning you want to convey in your sentence and construct accordingly.</p>

            <title>Infinitives</title>
            <introduction>
                <p><term>Infinitives</term> are verb forms composed of two words, such as <q>to write</q> or <q>to understand.</q> For instance, <q>I like to write sentences using infinitives</q> and <q>To understand infinitives, one should learn when to use them,</q> are examples of the infinitive verb form.</p>
                <p>But say you wanted to make these sentences a bit more descriptive. You can do this by adding an adverb or adverbial phrase to the verb forms, such as <q>clearly write</q> or <q>fully understand.</q> This may result in <q>splitting the infinitive,</q> where adverbs or adverbial phrases are inserted between the <q>to</q> and the root verb that follows, as in <q>to clearly write</q> or <q>to fully understand.</q> Split infinitives are hotly contested in the grammar world. Some grammarians argue we should always avoid splitting our infinitives while others assert splitting the infinitive isn't a hard rule and can be done if it preserves thought and sentence fluency. Therefore, it's hard to know when to avoid splitting an infinitive and when it's all right to leave it as is. Below are a few guidelines to help you decide whether or not to split your infinitives (infinitive verb forms are <un s="1">underlined</un>, adverbs are <em>italicized</em>).</p>
            </introduction>
            <subsubsection xml:id="when-to-split-infinitives">
                <title>When to split infinitives</title>
                <p>Sometimes the sentence meaning is clearer when the adverb modifying the verb stays within the verb form. For instance, consider the sentences below:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I like <un s="1">to</un> <em>clearly</em> <un s="1">write</un> sentences using infinitives.</q></p>
                    <p><q><un s="1">To</un> <em>fully</em> <un s="1">understand</un> infinitives, one should learn when to use them.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Both of these sentences have split infinitives (<q>to clearly write</q> and <q>to fully understand</q>). However, if we move the adverbs outside of the verb form, suddenly the sentences become less clear and more awkward:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I like <un s="1">to write</un> sentences <em>clearly</em> using infinitives.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, it is not clear whether <q>clearly</q> is modifying <q>to write</q> or <q>using infinitives</q>; does the person like to clearly write or clearly use infinitives? In this case, it might be better to leave the modifying adverb within the verb form.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q><un s="1">To understand</un> infinitives <em>fully</em>, one should learn when to use them.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, the modifying adverb <q>fully</q> is placed outside of the verb form <q>to understand.</q> While this placement does not interfere with the meaning or fluency of the sentence, it breaks up the logical unit of thought; one must refer back to the intact verb form <q>to understand</q> in order to identify what <q>fully</q> is modifying. Therefore, it might be better to split the infinitive so the reader has a clearer idea of what kind of understanding the sentence is promising (full understanding).</p>

                <title>When to avoid splitting infinitives</title>
                <p>While splitting the infinitive is sometimes necessary to preserve sentence fluency and thought coherency, it is usually better to avoid splitting them when you can. Infinitives are single units of thought, so keeping them intact often improves the reader's understanding of the sentence. Additionally, splitting the infinitive can actually make the sentence more awkward. For instance, take the following sentences where the infinitives are intact:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>You should try <un s="1">to keep</un> infinitives intact <em>whenever possible</em>.</q></p>
                    <p><q>I would like <un s="1">to write</un> sentences with infinitives <em>clearly and concisely</em>.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Both of these sentences keep the infinitive intact (<q>to keep</q> and <q>to write</q>). But say you tried to split the infinitives:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>You should try <un s="1">to</un> <em>whenever possible</em> <un s="1">keep</un> infinitives intact.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, inserting the modifier <q>whenever possible</q> between the verb form makes the sentence awkward and unwieldy. In this case, keeping the infinitive <q>to keep</q> intact makes the sentence more readable and clear.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I would like <un s="1">to</un> <em>clearly and concisely</em> <un s="1">write</un> sentences with infinitives.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Similarly, the infinitive verb form <q>to write</q> in this sentence is split by the modifying phrase <q>clearly and concisely.</q> In this case, splitting the infinitive with the modifier disrupts sentence fluency and expression of the verb form <q>to write</q>; therefore, it's probably better to keep the infinitive phrase intact.</p>

                <p><q>Each</q> is a singular pronoun and requires a singular verb. Therefore, even if the subject of the sentence is plural, <q>each</q> refers to every single member of that group and should be treated as a singular pronoun.</p>

            <title>Challenges with Subject-Verb Agreement</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>As we have seen, subjects and verbs (predicates) are the primary components of any sentence. Therefore, it is important that they <q>agree,</q> or match each other in terms of plurality. In other words, single subjects require singular verbs, and plural subjects require plural verbs. For instance, in <init>SAE</init>, you wouldn't say <q>Amanda <em>jog</em> to the field house,</q> but rather <q>Amanda <em>jogs</em> to the field house.</q> Similarly, if the subject is plural, you would change the verb accordingly: <q>The soccer players <em>is</em> tired</q> would become <q>The soccer players <em>are</em> tired.</q> Use the following guidelines to help you figure out if the subject and verb of your sentence <q>agree.</q></p>

                <title>Problems with subject-verb agreement</title>
                <p>Any student of a foreign language knows that consistent subject and verb agreement can be a pain. Even in a first language, writers and speakers alike can confuse whether a word is singular or plural (a group?<mdash/>hint: it's singular), or<mdash/>in the middle of complex sentences<mdash/>forget whether the subject of their sentence was singular or plural. Thankfully, we have the opportunity to revise when we write!</p>
                <p>Here are a few rules to help guide you through tricky sentences.</p>
                <sidebyside>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>When the subject of a sentence is composed of two or more nouns/pronouns connected by <q>and,</q> use a plural verb:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>President Crawford and professors <em>meet</em> with students frequently.</q></p>
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When the subject of a sentence is composed of two or more nouns/pronouns connected by <q>or</q> or <q>nor,</q> the <em>verb corresponds with the noun or pronoun closest to it:</em></p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>Either President Crawford or professors <em>meet</em> with students frequently.</q></p>
                                <p><q>Either professors or President Crawford <em>meets</em> with students frequently.</q></p>
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When the subject of a sentence is a collective noun (group, jury, band, <etc/>) or a title (of a book, play, country, <etc/>), the verb will always be singular.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>I hope that band plays at LogJam! again.</q></p>
                                <p><q>The newest edition of <em>Crosscurrents</em> is great.</q></p>
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When a phrase sits in between the subject and the verb, be sure that your verb agrees with your subject, not with the phrase.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>The <em>number</em> of on-campus trees <em>grows</em> each year.</q></p>
                                <p><q>The <em>Passages leader</em>, alongside all of their passagees, <em>was</em> excited to reach the end of the trail.</q></p>
                            </blockquote>

                </sidebyside>
                <p>There are also some English words, especially in the sciences, that have tricky plural forms, so you might not even realize that the word you're using is actually plural. One great example is the word <em>data</em>, which is plural (<em><q>The data suggest that<ellipsis/></q></em>).</p>
                <p>Other examples include criteria/criterion, media/medium, and phenomena/phenomenon.</p>

                    <p>What may seem like problems with subject-verb agreement might actually be <em>correct</em> subject-verb agreement in another variety of English.</p>

            <subsubsection xml:id="pronoun-antecedent-not-agreeing">
                <title>Lack of agreement between pronoun and antecedent, especially the use of <q>they</q> as a singular pronoun</title>
                <p>Problems with agreement occur most commonly when a writer mentions a subject, a movie director, for example, and then uses a pronoun (recall: he, she, they, it) to refer back to that subject. When the subject's gender is unspecified, it is unclear whether the subject (in this case, the director) should be referred to as <q>he</q> or <q>she.</q> Because the plural pronoun <q>they</q> is gender-neutral, many writers, consciously or not, opt to use <q>they</q> instead of <q>he,</q> <q>she,</q> or the more cumbersome phrase <q>he or she.</q> (see <xref ref="basic-sentence-structure" text="title"/>)</p>
                <p>A sentence using <q>they</q> but referring to a singular pronoun looks like this:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I liked what the director of the movie did. They did a good job.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In terms of grammatical correctness, formal, standard English requires writers to make the correct agreement between a pronoun and its antecedent (<ie/>, you have to use singular pronouns for singular antecedents). For a gender-unspecified singular antecedent, then, a writer has a few options: to use the phrase <q>he or she,</q> to make the subject plural if possible, or to avoid the issue altogether by restructuring the sentence. A sentence of this sort would therefore take one of these three forms:
                    <ol>
                        <li><p><q>I liked what the director of the movie did. He or she did a good job.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>That movie had a good director. When directors pay special attention to lighting like this director did, they are doing a good job.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>That movie was great! I can't believe how well the director focused on light!</q></p></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>You are living through an important and interesting time in the progression of the English language. <q>Formal</q> and <q>standard</q> English (among most other languages) has historically belonged to people in power, people who have used (and still use) language to discriminate against and subjugate individuals who speak non standard forms of English. In spite of this subjugation, speakers of English<mdash/>standard and non standard<mdash/>are beginning to gain power and to reclaim English from those who use it to oppress. Since language and power are intimately intertwined, shifts in power inevitably lead to subsequent shifts in language. These shifts explain why it is now inappropriate to use <q>he</q> as the default pronoun and why <q>they</q> is becoming increasingly accepted as a gender-neutral, third-person singular pronoun. While conservative grammarians may lament the devolution of <q>proper English,</q> the reality is that language belongs to its speakers, not to those in power. By acknowledging these shifts in language (and the reasons behind them) within academia, we work toward increasing the access to and inclusivity of the academy. What inevitably follows are new perspectives, experiences, and identities that may lead to even greater equity among scholars and the types of knowledge they produce.</p>

                <title>Either/Or, Neither/Nor</title>
                <p>
                    If <q>either</q> and <q>neither</q> are being used to differentiate a singular item or a singular item among several, they are singular pronouns and need a singular verb.
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Would you prefer a drip coffee or caffeinated tea?</q> <q>Either is fine with me.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>Neither of the two coffee machines in Diversions is working.</q></p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If <q>either</q> and <q>neither</q> are being used in interrogative statements, they can use a plural verb.
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Are either of you going to the women's lacrosse game?</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>Have neither of my books arrived from ILLiad, yet?</q></p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If <q>either</q> and <q>neither</q> are referring to either one item or another item (two items separated by the conjunction <q>or</q> or <q>nor</q>), the verb is determined by the plurality of the item that lies closest to it. A good rule of thumb is to look at the plurality of the subject/noun closest to the verb and change the verb accordingly. However, even if a sentence is grammatically correct, you may have to fiddle with the order of the items in order to make the sentence sound more clear. For instance, take the following example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Neither my teammates nor my coach was expecting it to rain during practice.</q></p></li>
                    </ul>
                    While grammatically correct, this sentence still sounds slightly awkward. Consider a possible revision of the item order below.
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Neither my coach nor my teammates were expecting it to rain during practice.</q> (Sounds much better.)</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are some more examples of using <q>either/or</q> and <q>neither/nor.</q>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Either the geology team or the physics team is going to win the science basketball tournament in the Thompson courtyard.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>Neither the tables nor the couches in Diversions are open.</q></p></li>

            <subsubsection>
                <title>Of</title>
                <p>
                    When using a phrase beginning with <q>of</q> to modify a subject, the subject always comes before the phrase. Therefore, the verb should agree with the subject before the word <q>of.</q>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>The murder of crows targets the dropped french fry.</q></p></li>

            <subsubsection>
                <title>And/Or</title>
                <p>
                    When using <q>and</q> in a sentence to combine two or more subjects, use a plural verb. When using <q>or</q> in a sentence to differentiate between two or more subjects, the verb should agree with the plurality of whatever subject is closest to it.
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Education, occupational therapy, and physical therapy are the three graduate degrees offered at Puget Sound.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>My sister or my brothers are coming to visit me on campus.</q></p></li>

                <title>Confusing Modifiers</title>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the subject and verb are separated by modifying phrases and adjectives that describe the subject. While modifiers are useful for adding specificity to sentences, they can be confusing when you are trying to make your subject and verb agree. If you spot a modifier, skip over it and make your verb singular or plural based on the subject. In the following examples, subjects are underlined and verbs are italicised.
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q><un s="1">President Crawford</un>, along with the first-year students, <em>is attending</em> Convocation.</q></p></li>

                <title>Collective Nouns</title>
                <p>There are some subjects that may be singular or plural depending on how you use them.</p>
                <p>In order to determine whether to use a singular or a plural verb, ask yourself: Are the people in the group acting as a single unit, or is each individual in the group acting individually? If the group is acting as a single unit, use singular. If each individual in the group is acting individually, use plural. (To help with the plural instances, try seeing if it would make sense to write <q><fillin/> members,</q> like <q>jury members</q> or <q>council members.</q>)</p>

            <title>Sentence Fragments</title>
            <p>Sentence fragments are incomplete sentences. Like here. That sentence is not a complete sentence because it cannot stand on its own and make sense.</p>
            <p>
                So how do you avoid sentence fragments?
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Ensure that your sentence has a subject and a verb and that it expresses a complete thought.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Word processing programs can help you to identify fragments<mdash/>but don't depend on them!</p></li>
                    <li><p>Mentally take your sentence out of context, then ask yourself, <em><q>Does this sentence alone make sense?</q></em></p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do find a sentence fragment, try these two revision tips:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Add the necessary components of a sentence that the fragment is missing.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Combine the sentence fragment with another sentence.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of sentence fragments and revisions:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>To the <acro>SUB</acro>.</q> → <q>You should take your <acro>SUB</acro> dishes back to the <acro>SUB</acro>.</q> In this revision, we combine the fragment with the independent clause, <q>You should take your <acro>SUB</acro> dishes back.</q> By sticking the fragment on an independent clause, we not only get rid of the fragment, but we also add more specificity to the sentence.</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>All night long!</q> → <q>I was in the library all night long!</q> Just like the previous example, this fix gets rid of the fragment and makes the sentence more specific. <q>How long were you in the library?</q> <q>I was in the library all night long!</q></p></li>

            <title>Problems with Parallelism</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>Parallel sentence structure is a common pattern used to illustrate two or more ideas, items, or phrases that are equally emphasized in a sentence. It's helpful to use parallel structure when you want to include a list of something or apply a series of words, phrases, or clauses to the same adjective or pronoun. This condenses the sentence, making it more efficient and less repetitive. For instance, say Polly likes to do three things. One way of listing those three things would be to write, <q>Polly likes to read books, likes to drink coffee, and likes to pet cats.</q> But that's a pretty tedious sentence. Instead, you could use parallel structure to condense the sentence: <q>Polly likes to read books, drink coffee, and pet cats.</q> In this sentence, the verb phrase <q>likes to</q> applies equally to the infinitive phrases <q>read books,</q> <q>drink coffee,</q> and <q>pet cats.</q></p>
                <p>However, sometimes it's easy to lose yourself while using parallel sentence structure by being inconsistent with your word, phrase, or clause forms. For instance, consider this common incorrect rewriting of the above sentence: <q>Polly likes to read books, drink coffee, and petting cats.</q> This is incorrect parallel sentence structure because the word forms are not the same; the verb phrase <q>likes to</q> applies to reading books and drinking coffee, but not to petting cats because the verb <q>petting</q> takes care of itself. The sentence indicates that Polly <q>likes to read books,</q> <q>likes to drink coffee,</q> and <q>likes to petting cats,</q> which has too many active verbs (<q>likes to</q> and <q>petting</q>). By replacing the infinitive form of <q>to pet</q> with the gerund form <q>petting,</q> the sentence now doesn't make very much sense. Sometimes inconsistent forms can be tricky to identify, especially when you have a series of complex clauses or phrases. Below are some common examples of parallel structure errors to watch out for.</p>

                <title>Mixing Word Forms</title>
                <p>The above sentence is an example of mixing word forms (to read, to drink, and petting). If you have a verb that applies to two or more of the items in the series, it must apply to all items equally in order to preserve correct parallel structure. Take the following example of mixing word forms:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Oppenheimer is a relaxing place to study; it is calm, quiet, and has lots of windows.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, the attributes <q>calm</q> and <q>quiet</q> equally share the verb <q>is</q>: Oppenheimer <q>is calm</q> and <q>is quiet.</q> However, the last attribute in the series (<q>has lots of windows</q>), departs from this structure by introducing another verb, <q>has,</q> to characterize the attribute <q>lots of windows,</q> throwing the series out of balance. If <q>is</q> is applied equally to each attribute, Oppenheimer <q>is calm,</q> <q>is quiet,</q> and <q>is has lots of windows.</q> To fix this mixed word form, you must do one of two things: 1) either break up the attributes into two different items using the conjunction <q>and</q> or 2) arrange the attributes so they share a single verb and adhere to the parallel structure.</p>
                <p>
                    Examples of these fixes are shown below:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Oppenheimer is a relaxing place to study; it is calm and quiet and has lots of windows.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>Oppenheimer is a relaxing place to study; it is calm, quiet, and airy.</q></p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <subsubsection>
                <title>Mixing Clause Forms</title>
                <p>The same rule may be applied to a series of complex clauses. If you have a verb that applies to two or more clauses in the series, it must apply equally to all clauses in order to maintain parallel structure. Take the following example of mixing clause forms:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Diversions has cut a lot of paper waste by offering mug discounts, free Cup Karma drinks, more <q>for-here</q> options, and by encouraging people to recycle their coffee cup lids and sleeves.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, Diversions has cut a lot of waste by doing two things: 1) offering mug discounts, free Cup Karma drinks, and more <q>for-here</q> options and 2) encouraging people to recycle. While the first three clauses in the series (discounts, drinks, and options) all share the verb <q>offering</q> equally, the fourth clause (recycling lids and sleeves) only uses the verb <q>encouraging.</q> To correct this sentence to preserve parallel structure, you have to insert the conjunction <q>and</q> between the second and third clauses to distinguish what Diversions is <q>offering</q> from what it is <q>encouraging.</q> Take the corrected revision:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Diversions has cut a lot of paper waste by offering mug discounts, free Cup Karma drinks, and more <q>for-here</q> options and by encouraging people to recycle their coffee cup lids and sleeves.</q></p>

                <title>Two Nouns Following One Adjective</title>
                <p>When you have two or more nouns following an adjective, that adjective must apply to all nouns equally. This can be a tricky mistake to identify; when we read, we often only think to apply the adjective to the noun that immediately follows it in the sentence. However, it's important to make sure that either all nouns share the same adjective equally or each noun has its own adjective in a series. Take the following example of an adjective that is incorrectly applied to both nouns:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>The Cellar's rambunctious atmosphere and array of ice cream flavors make it a good place to go to unwind.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This sentence indicates that the adjective <q>rambunctious</q> applies to both <q>atmosphere</q> and <q>array of ice cream flavors.</q> While the first association makes sense, it would be strange to describe an array of ice cream flavors as <q>rambunctious.</q> Instead, both nouns must either share an adjective that describes both of them or they must have their own adjectives.</p>
                <p>
                    To fix this sentence, you can do one of two things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>add an adjective that applies to <q>array of ice cream flavors</q></p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>The Cellar's rambunctious atmosphere and diverse array of ice cream flavors make it a good place to go to unwind.</q></p>
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>repeat the pronoun before <q>array</q> to prevent the misperception that it is a <q>rambunctious array</q></p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>The Cellar's rambunctious atmosphere and its array of ice cream flavors make it a good place to go to unwind.</q></p>
                            </blockquote>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <title>Lists After a Colon</title>
                <p>When you have a list after a colon, the parallel structure rule should be equally applied to all items in that list. Take this example of a list that does not follow parallel structure:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>The sandwich station at the <acro>SUB</acro> has the following spread options: hummus, pesto, mayo, mustard, and it also has relish.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This list breaks parallel structure with the last item, <q>it also has relish,</q> which adds both a subject (<q>it</q>) and verb (<q>has</q>) to the list item (<q>relish</q>). To make this sentence adhere to parallel structure, the list item must be in the same form as the other items in the list:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>The sandwich station at the <acro>SUB</acro> has the following spread options: hummus, pesto, mayo, mustard, and relish.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    To avoid these and other parallel structure errors, here are some things to keep in mind while writing and proofreading:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>While writing a list or series, make sure every item in the series is grammatically consistent (all -ing endings vs. infinitive, passive vs. active voice, <etc/>).</p></li>
                        <li><p>If you have an adjective or pronoun to describe the first word of a series, apply that descriptor equally to every item in the series to make sure it makes sense.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Read carefully through your paper, paying close attention to series connected by conjunctions (<q>and</q>/<q>or</q>) and checking either side of the sentence for correct parallel structure.</p></li>
                        <li><p>If you have a list or series, isolate every item into its own sentence, identify descriptors you can attribute to every item, and then condense the sentence accordingly.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <title>Misplaced Modifiers</title>
                <p>While modifiers can be extremely useful for spicing up sentences, they can sometimes be misplaced too far from the noun they are intending to describe. These <term>misplaced modifiers</term> not only make the sentence confusing to read; they also may actually end up describing something they're not supposed to describe. For instance, take the following sentence:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Towering above the heads of the students, we gazed in awe up at the sequoia tree.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, <q>towering above the heads of the students</q> is a participial phrase (see <xref ref="participial-phrases" text="title"/> in <xref ref="common-types-of-phrases"/>). However, it's currently being used to describe the pronoun <q>we.</q> Unless <q>we</q> are giants, this sentence doesn't make much sense; how can <q>we</q> tower above the heads of students? Instead, the participial phrase is likely intended to describe the sequoia tree. Consider a revision that places the modifier next to the noun it describes:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>We gazed in awe up at the sequoia tree towering above the heads of the students.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Here are a few more examples of misplaced modifiers and their possible revisions:</p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><q>Liam sprinted up the staircase to his class on the top floor of McIntyre, which was steep and exhausting.</q></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The placement of this modifier makes it seem like the top floor of McIntyre is <q>steep and exhausting.</q></p>
                        <p>Revision:</p>
                        <blockquote>

                <title>Dangling Modifiers</title>
                <p>In addition to misplaced modifiers, a <term>dangling modifier</term> describes a noun that is either unclear or absent from the sentence altogether. In these cases, the modifier ends up modifying something else in the sentence that should not be modified. For instance, take the following sentence:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>After writing for hours in Collins Library, the paper was finally finished.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, <q>after writing for hours</q> is a participle phrase modifying <q>the paper.</q> But a paper can't write itself! Instead, the participle phrase should modify the subject doing the action (in this case, the student writing the paper):</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>After writing for hours in Collins Library, the exhausted student finally finished their paper.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Here are a few more examples of dangling modifiers and their possible revisions:</p>
                <example>
                    <statement>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><q>Unfamiliar with the campus layout, it was difficult to find their classroom in Wyatt.</q></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This sentence is confusing because the modifier, <q>Unfamiliar with the campus layout,</q> is modifying a noun that doesn't exist. To fix this problem, we need to add a noun.</p>
                        <p>Revision:</p>
                        <blockquote>

            <title>Writing Clearly and Precisely</title>
            <p>When you have what you believe to be a brilliant idea and a strong argument, it is sometimes tempting to try to sound impressive by using a lot of words. More is better, right? Not necessarily! If more words and specialized vocabulary will make your meaning more clear to a specific audience, then it's worth it to use longer, more complex wording. But if complicated language makes the sentence (and your point) more confusing, it's better to state your ideas simply.</p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of long-winded ways to say relatively simple things:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>At this juncture in time<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> → now, currently</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>By virtue of the fact<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> → because</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>For the purpose of<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> → to</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>In all likelihood<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> → probably</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>In the event that<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> → if</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>In this regard, it is of significance that<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q> → simply omit and get on with your sentence</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>The truth is that<nbsp/><ellipsis/></q>  →  simply omit and get on with your sentence</p></li>
                    <li><p><q>Until such time as</q> → until</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>These kinds of empty phrases do not improve your writing and only add a tiny bit to the length of your paper (and length probably isn't the most important thing your professor wanted you to produce, anyhow). If you're hoping to sound scholarly, look closely at the precise and specific scholarly language that is used in your discipline.</p>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Broad use of <q>this,</q> especially as the subject of a sentence</title>
                <p>Readers like specificity. Using <q>this</q> too much, especially as the subject of a sentence (<eg/> <q>This is what I'm talking about.</q>) conveys too much ambiguity. To what does <q>this</q> refer? Instead of writing <q>this,</q> try to use an interesting word that refers specifically to what you want to talk about. For example, I could write an essay about my dog, Chuck, and say, <q>Chuck likes to take walks. This is why I walk him every day.</q> To avoid using <q>this</q> as the subject of the sentence, though, I could say something like: <q>Chuck likes to take walks. I walk him every day because he loves walks so much.</q> In this sentence, <q>this</q> is replaced with <q>because he loves walks so much.</q></p>
                <p>You can also simply restructure the sentence(s) to avoid using <q>this</q> as the subject. From the example above, I could also say, <q>Chuck likes to take walks, so I walk him every day.</q> Finally, you can think of a noun that tells your reader what <q>this</q> is referring to: <em>this</em> quote, <em>this</em> information, <em>this</em> verdict, <em>this</em> distinction, <em>this</em> occurrence, <em>this</em> sentiment, <etc/></p>

            <title>Making Effective Word Choices</title>
            <p>Strong word choice improves the quality of a paper and helps hold the reader's interest; inversely, using words incorrectly or ineffectively can lessen the writer's credibility. As you entrain for forthcoming linguistic endeavors, exploit these pointers to ensure your belles-lettres aren't as annoying and incorrect as this sentence has been.</p>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Incorrect Word Choice</title>
                <p>Incorrect word choice usually occurs when a writer uses a word outside of its standard definition or context. This misuse can happen for a variety of reasons, including the writer having a wrong mental definition of the word, not knowing the word's popular connotation, or using the word in an inappropriate disciplinary context.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <list>
                <paragraphs><title>How to avoid misusing words</title>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>If there's a word that comes to mind when you're writing and you're not completely sure of its meaning, err on the side of caution and look it up! (We, for example,  just looked up <q>err</q> to make sure that was the right word to use.)</p></li>
                    <li><p>If you select a word from a thesaurus, make sure to also look the word up in a dictionary (online, of course). The dictionary definition and example sentences will help you catch any connotations or standard uses of the word that you might not otherwise be familiar with.</p></li>
                    <li><p>When writing in a specific discipline, it can be difficult to know what words are specific to that discipline and how they are used differently in academic writing than they are in standard, every day conversation. In statistics, for example, <em><q>significant</q></em> has a very specific meaning (<ie/>, having statistical importance), and any other uses of the word are incorrect and generally avoided. Similarly, <em><q>conjugation</q></em> has a very different meaning in biology than it does in Spanish. So how do you avoid misusing words in disciplines with which you are unfamiliar?

                <title>Ineffective Word Choice</title>
                <p>While academic writing usually employs more abstruse and sophisticated language than you find in every day conversation, sometimes using <q>big words</q> simply to sound smart can come across to an audience as pedantic. Words that are overly complicated and obfuscate the meaning of a sentence are therefore ineffective; if the point of writing is to convey meaning clearly, a confusing word should not get in the way of that meaning.</p>
                <p><em>Alternatively, using words or phrases that are too simplistic, overused, or trite can also ineffectively convey meaning to a reader.</em> Passive sentences, phrases constructed around <q>to be,</q> and clichés like <q>to be honest</q> all diminish the point you're trying to convey to a reader.</p>

            <title>Using Passive Constructions Cautiously</title>
            <p>The <term>passive voice</term> is <em>passive</em> because sentences in this structure de-emphasize the role of the actor in a sentence. An active sentence puts the actor front and center (<q>Sally hugged Barbara</q>) whereas a passive sentence holds the actor less prominently and places the action/object acted upon front and center (<q>Barbara was hugged by Sally</q>). The active sentence emphasizes Sally as the actor, whereas the passive sentence emphasizes that Barbara received a hug. Note that passive constructions can only occur in sentences with <term>transitive verbs</term>, which take direct objects.</p>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of active versus passive voice:
                <dl>
                    <li>
                        <title>Active</title>
                        <p><q>Sally hugged Barbara.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Passive</title>
                        <p><q>Barbara was hugged by Sally.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Active</title>
                        <p><q>I did my homework.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Active</title>
                        <p><q>My roommate woke me up as she got ready for crew practice.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Passive</title>
                        <p><q>I was woken up by my roommate as she got ready for crew practice.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Active</title>
                        <p><q>We made mistakes.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Passive</title>
                        <p><q>Mistakes were made.</q></p>
                        <p>(Notice how this form completely omits the actor<mdash/>Who made the mistakes? We don't know! They just were made<ellipsis/>)</p>
                    </li>
                </dl>

            <p>
                Below are some ways you can identify the passive voice. Please note that these tips are general guidelines, not concrete characteristics of every instance of passive voice.
                <ul>
                    <li><p><em>Look for <q>to be</q> verbs.</em> The passive voice is often constructed in this format: <em><q>to be</q> + past participle.</em> Notice that the previous sentence is passive. It has <q>is</q> as the form of <q>to be</q> and <q>constructed</q> as the past participle.</p></li>
                    <li><p><em>Look for <q>by</q> + a noun/pronoun/proper noun.</em> As with the example <q>Barbara was hugged by Sally,</q> passive sentences often use the word <q>by</q> to show that someone or something carried out the action. Barbara wasn't <em>just</em> hugged, she was hugged <em>by Sally.</em></p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            While the passive voice is not grammatically incorrect, most readers (and professors) prefer the active voice because readers generally want to identify the action happening in a piece of writing. Since the active voice makes it easier to identify what is happening and who or what is acting, the active voice usually makes more sense as a writing style. Similarly, the active voice also clarifies the meaning of and give more details about a sentence. Consider these examples:
                            <dl>
                                <li>
                                    <title>Passive</title>
                                    <p><q>We were asked by the flight attendant to have our luggage put in the overhead compartment by a man next to us who went by the name of Jim.</q></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <title>Active</title>
                                    <p><q>The flight attendant asked us to have Jim, the man sitting next to us, put our luggage in the overhead compartment.</q></p>
                                </li>
                            </dl>
                            In both examples, there are three main people: us (the writer), the flight attendant, and Jim. The first example, the one in the passive voice, becomes long and confusing. The reader will have forgotten who asked whom to do what by the time Jim's name comes up. The second example, however, more clearly explains the scenario because there is less confusion about who is doing what.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <assemblage>
                <p>The large exception to these preferences is science. Most scientific work tends to be written in the passive voice. An active version of the previous sentence would be, <q>Most scientists tend to write in the passive voice.</q> Notice how the first version, the passive one, takes the actor out of the sentence completely. Who does the passive writing in the sciences? The active version answers that question: scientists write in the passive voice in science writing. Sciences tend to use the passive voice to distance the scientist from the science being done. The passive voice is therefore used strategically by the sciences. (Again, the previous sentence could also be active: <q>The sciences (or scientists) therefore use the passive voice strategically.</q>)</p>

            <title>Using Strong Verbs</title>
            <p>While we use <q>to be</q> frequently in our every day speech, the verb is often too weak as the main verb in formal writing. Uses of <q>to be</q> include: <em>to be, being, am, is, are, was, and were.</em></p>
            <p>Writers prefer not to overuse <q>to be</q> because English contains plenty of stronger (<ie/>, more active, informative, and interesting) verbs. <q>To be</q> also frequently indicates that you are using passive voice. (See item number nine on this list.) Using <q>to be</q> too much thus makes your writing boring or too passive. Which passage below do you prefer?</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><q>I was going to Diversions when I saw something that was interesting. It was my friend, Sally. Sally was outside and was sleeping on her chemistry textbook.</q></p>
                <p><q>On my way to Diversions, I happened upon an interesting (and funny) sight: my friend, Sally, had fallen asleep outside, using her chemistry textbook as a pillow!</q></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Try using a thesaurus to find alternative words. But use caution! Sometimes thesauruses mislead writers when the writer doesn't fully understand the connotation or typical uses of a synonym.</p>
            <p>Here's a list of strong verbs to consider using. There are short definitions to give you an idea of what the word means, but be sure to look up any words you use to make sure that the contexts in which you're using them align with their meaning. There may also be alternative meanings that aren't listed here, so the dictionary and thesaurus will still be your friends.</p>

            <introduction>
                <p><term>Homophones</term> are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings. Because homophones share the same pronunciations (or sound similar), they are commonly confused in writing, especially when you know the spelling of one homophone but intend to convey the other. Below is a list of commonly confused homophones and some example sentences using them. But if you are unsure of a word and it's not listed here, try looking it up in a dictionary or thesaurus to make sure it's the word you want!</p>

                <p>One of the more common homophone errors writers make is between <q>its</q> and <q>it's.</q> While they sound the same, <q>its</q> is the possessive pronoun of <q>it</q> and <q>it's</q> is the contraction of <q>it is.</q> One way to differentiate them is to identify why you are using one version or the other. <q>Its</q> is used to convey possession by an inanimate object, action, idea, animal, group, or person whose gender is overlooked, as in the sentence <q>The dog bounded happily toward its owner on Todd Field.</q> <q>It's</q> with an apostrophe is used to indicate <q>it is</q> or the past tense <q>it was,</q> as in the sentences <q>It's [it is] a universally acknowledged belief that a dog is a human's best friend,</q> or <q>It's [it has] been great getting to know all the dogs that frequent campus.</q> If you are trying to figure out which form to use, try splitting <q>its</q> into <q>it is</q> or <q>it was</q> and see if the sentence still makes sense. For instance, the sentence <q>The dog bounded happily toward it is owner on Todd Field,</q> does not make very much sense, so this may be an indication that the correct form to use is <q>its.</q></p>
                <p>Below are some sentence examples of <q>its</q> and <q>it's</q> to help you distinguish which form to use.</p>

                <title>Period <dblbrackets>.</dblbrackets></title>
                <p>One period:<ul>
                    <li><p>Use periods at the end of complete sentences. ← Like that!</p></li>
                    <li><p>Periods can also go in between and after the letters of certain abbreviations. For example, <eg/>, M.D., <etc/></p></li>

                <title>Ellipsis <dblbrackets><ellipsis/></dblbrackets> (AKA: <q>dot dot dot</q>)</title>
                <p>Use an ellipsis to show that you have omitted part of a quotation.</p>
                <example>
                    <p><em>The Trail</em> reporter wrote, <q>The skit, which was held in the Rendezvous Room, showcased <ellipsis/> the many skills of Puget Sound's improv group, Ubiquitous They.</q></p>
                </example>
                <p>Use four periods when you omit a quote that contains the end of a sentence. The fourth period indicates to the reader that the sentence has ended and that the next portion of the quoted material comes from a different sentence.</p>
                <example>
                    <p>Original quote<mdash/><q>I love that the <acro>SUB</acro> has sunbutter and bananas. It's great because I'm allergic to peanuts.</q></p>
                    <p>Quoted portion<mdash/><q>I love that the <acro>SUB</acro> has sunbutter <ellipsis/> . It's great because I'm allergic to peanuts.</q></p>

                    <p><q>Use an exclamation mark when you want to show excitement! (Like this!)</q></p>

                <title>Comma <dblbrackets>,</dblbrackets></title>
                <p>There are five main ways to use a comma. You can use them:<ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>to connect <em>two complete sentences</em> with the coordinating conjunctions that make up the acronym <acro>FANBOYS</acro> (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).</p>
                        <p><q>I love using commas, but I need to remember the five main ways to use them!</q></p>
                        <p>BUT: You DON'T need to put a comma before one of the FANBOYS words if what precedes or follows the word is not a complete sentence (<eg/>, <q>I love using commas but can't remember how to use them</q> → <q>but can't remember how to use them</q> is not a complete sentence).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>to separate an <em>introductory</em> or <em>explanatory</em> phrase from the rest of the sentence.</p>
                        <p><q>Having finished her last final, Shelly skipped with joy down Commencement Walk.</q></p>
                        <p><q>The dog, who had gotten in the habit of walking every day at 3 p.m., grabbed his leash and ran to his owner.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>with transitional phrases (however, moreover, therefore, and for example).</p>
                        <p><q>For example, you can use a comma in a sentence like this.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>to separate items in a list or series.</p>
                        <p><q>My favorite foods from the <acro>SUB</acro> include hummus, Greek yogurt, and apples.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>with coordinate adjectives (<ie/>, adjectives that you could combine with <q>and</q>).</p>
                        <p><q>My RA is the nicest, funniest person on campus.</q></p>
                    </li>

                    <title>Comma splices</title>
                    <p>These occur when a writer joins two independent clauses with a comma (see <xref ref="basic-sentence-structure" text="title"/>). Recall that an independent clause is a sentence with a subject, verb, and complete idea. <em><q>Comma splices are weird, they look like this.</q></em> Comma splices make sentences less precise, can you see how this comma splice makes my sentence quite confused?</p>
                    <p>
                        What can you do instead? You have several options!
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>You can keep the sentences as they are and replace the comma with a semicolon. This option works for sentences that are too closely related for a period but for which a coordinating conjunction would be inappropriate. (For example, <em><q>I like cats; they are cute.</q></em>)</p></li>
                            <li><p>You can split the clauses into two sentences: <em><q>Comma splices make sentences less precise. Can you see how the absence of a comma splice improves my sentence(s)?</q></em></p></li>
                            <li><p>You can put a coordinating conjunction (see <xref ref="parts-of-speech"/>) after the comma and before the second clause: <em><q>I love using commas, <em>but</em> I know that they don't belong between two independent clauses without a conjunction.</q></em></p></li>
                            <li><p>You can alter the clauses so that one is no longer an independent clause: <em><q>Comma splices aren't great, which is why I don't use them.</q></em></p></li>
                            <li><p>Finally, if possible, you can also combine the idea into one sentence/independent clause: <em><q>I don't use comma splices.</q></em></p></li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <p>You can use them to separate items in a list when there are also commas.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>You can also use them to separate two independent clauses and to show your reader that those independent clauses are closely related.</p>

                <title>Colon <dblbrackets>:</dblbrackets></title>
                <p>Only use a colon after a complete sentence. Colons tell a reader that what follows is directly related to the sentence that preceded the colon. The following information could be a list of items or another clause.</p>
                <example>
                    <p><q>Please grab me a couple of things from The Cellar: a container of ice cream, a carton of eggs, and some guacamole.</q></p>
                </example>

                    <p>You don't usually need to capitalize the word following a colon (unless it's a proper noun), but some style guides recommend it, so if you have questions, as always, ask your professor.</p>

                <p>Dashes<mdash/>and there are two types<mdash/>are used to hyphenate, to indicate ranges, or to set apart important or noteworthy things in a sentence.</p>
                <p>The <em>en dash</em> (also known as a hyphen). This dash is the dash that appears when you hit the dash key once. You can use it to hyphenate words (like in-depth) or to show a range (1894<ndash/>1904 or numbers 1<ndash/>5).</p>
                <p>The <em>em dash</em> (also known as a dash). Make an em dash by hitting the dash key twice<mdash/>like this! These longer dashes are what you use to set things apart<mdash/>you can use them with fragments or complete sentences. Like the earlier example<mdash/>the one up above<mdash/>you can use two em dashes to set something apart, or you can use one em dash like the previous two sentences.</p>

                <title>Parentheses <dblbrackets>(these)</dblbrackets></title>
                <p>Aside from citations (see <xref ref="citations"/>), parentheses are used in writing to separate words, phrases, or sentences from the main text. When you want to add additional information that doesn't fit well within the main part of a sentence, you can use parentheses to inform your reader while simultaneously keeping your sentence flowing (like this). (Or you can just use parentheses on their own to indicate that something is an aside or afterthought.) For more details on how to use other types of punctuation with parentheses (<eg/>, where does the period go?!), see <xref ref="period-inside-or-outside"/>!</p>
                <p>You can also use parentheses in area codes, like 253.879.3404 (which is, coincidentally, the phone number to the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching [<init>CWLT</init>]).</p>

                <p>
                    Brackets are kind of weird and don't seem to come up much, but, in general, you can associate them with quoted or parenthetical material. You should use brackets when you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>include a quote that requires clarification to make sense.</p>
                            <p><q>She said that they [her roommates] are the best.</q></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>include a quote that doesn't fit well within the syntax of your sentence (<eg/>, your quote starts with a lowercase letter, but you put it at the beginning of a sentence).</p>
                            <p><q>[T]hey are the best,</q> Shelly said about her roommates.</p>
                            <p>Shelly loved her roommates last year; she said <q>they [were] the best.</q> (Here, we've changed the present tense <q>are</q> to the past tense <q>were</q> in order to match the tense of the sentence.)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>want to tell your reader that you have or haven't added something (<eg/>, italics or a grammatical mistake) to a quote.</p>
                            <p><q>Rainier looked <em>so</em> beautiful today</q> [emphasis in original].</p>

                <title>Quotation Marks</title>
                <p>When you quote something, you are exactly replicating the words, phrases, and sentences of another source. Therefore, whenever you are quoting something directly, it's always a good idea to make sure you copy the quotation exactly as it appears in the source. Otherwise, you're inadvertently changing what the quote is saying! But sometimes when you write longer and more complicated quotes, you may forget to insert commas or emphases, type a wrong word, or end the quote incorrectly. Besides simply trying to copy the quote exactly, there are a few other guidelines to keep in mind while incorporating quotes into your writing.</p>

                            <p>All quotes require two sets of quotation marks, one set signifying the beginning of the quote and the other signifying the end. Therefore, whenever you use one set of quotations, be sure you follow them up with a second set at the end of the quote. For instance, take the following sentences:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>According to the first-year seminar student, <q>The <init>CWLT</init> is a great place to share your ideas, receive feedback on drafts, and improve your editing skills.</q></p>

                            <p>In order to introduce your quote to the reader, place a comma after the dialogue tag or introductory phrase that comes before your quote. For instance:</p>

If this is the case, you can use an ellipsis (<ellipsis/>) to replace the material you are omitting. However, it's important that the material you are replacing does not change the meaning or intent of the source material.</p>

                            <p>Because any quote comes from a larger context, an ellipsis is only needed at the beginning or end of a quote if it would appear otherwise that the entire sentence was quoted.</p>
                            <p>For example, if this were the original sentence, <q>I have never seen The Postmen play a game, but I really enjoy watching ultimate games because the players have so many cool frisbee throws!</q> then you would need an ellipsis if you cut the introductory or concluding clause: <q><ellipsis/> I really enjoy watching ultimate games <ellipsis/> .</q></p>

                            <p>Sometimes direct quotes have spelling or grammatical deviations from <init>SAE</init>. In order to preserve the original voice, it's important to include these deviations when possible and acknowledge them with an indicator ([sic], Latin for <q>thus</q>) after the perceived deviation. Similarly, if a part of your source material is underlined or italicized or in some other way emphasized, you should generally include this in your quotation. Emphases are indicated differently based on the citation style you are using (see <xref ref="citations"/>), but a basic guideline is to indicate emphases with <q>[emphasis in original]</q> at the end of or immediately following the quoted sentence.</p>

                    Apostrophes are also used to mark contractions, or two words combined, such as <q>could</q> and <q>have,</q> which can be contracted, or shortened, to <q>could've.</q> A single apostrophe takes the place of omitted letters.
                    <ul cols="2">
                        <li><p>Can't</p></li>
                        <li><p>We'd</p></li>
                        <li><p>It's</p></li>
                        <li><p>Won't</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><q>Won't</q> is an interesting case because its spelling does not correspond to its implied contraction <q>will not.</q> Linguists suspect that this is because, over time, the pronunciation of the contraction shifted such that <q>will</q> became <q>woll,</q> resulting in the current form <q>won't.</q> It should be noted that the above contractions constitute their own words without an apostrophe (cant, wed, its, and wont are all words). In order to avoid confusion, it is important to include the apostrophe in contractions.</p>
                <p>Apostrophes can also come at the front of a word, such as <q>'Twas</q> to mark omitted letters (omitted from <q>'Twas</q> is the letter <q>I</q>: <q>It was</q>).</p>
                <p>Apostrophes can also be used in conjunction with single letters (such as grades), abbreviations, and numerals (including years). There are no standard rules for these usages. Ask your professor for their preference and be consistent. Aim for clarity where necessary. For instance, the plural form <q>As</q> (referring to the letter grade) will likely be misread as <q>As</q> the word. Use an apostrophe here (<q>A's</q>).</p>

                            Capitalize formal titles when the title is used to address someone.

                                <li><p>How arbitrary is this rule? Unfortunately, Google does not provide a gradient that will tell you how formal a given title is. It is relatively safe to assume that a title such as <q>Admiral</q> is formal enough to be capitalized, while a title such as <q>mister</q> is more ambiguous. The lack of a standard will likely cause some confusion at some point in your college career. Once again, do not be afraid to ask.</p></li>

                            Capitalize family member's kinship names (Mom, Father) when they preface a proper name or when they are used in place of the name.

                            Knowing what to capitalize in titles can be incredibly confusing and frustrating. Different styles have their own policies, so consult the official stylebooks for the style in which you're writing. In general, when capitalizing, it is usually safe to capitalize:
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>The title's first word</p></li>
                                <li><p>Adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, nouns, proper nouns, and verbs (except the <q>to</q> in infinitives)</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It is usually safe not to capitalize:
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Articles (a, an, the)</p></li>
                                <li><p>Coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, for, yet, so, nor)</p></li>

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>It is also fairly painless to find a capitalization automator online, which will capitalize your title according to the stylesheet you choose. (Google search <q>Capitalize my title.</q>)</p></li>

                    <p>Maybe just forget about this one. (Just kidding<mdash/>kind of.) Despite being such a wonderful thing, the act of lying (laying?) down can cause a world of pain when trying to write about it. The crucial thing you must determine is what (or who) is doing the laying/lying: (1) Is someone or something lying down on their own? (2) Or is someone laying something (or someone) else down?</p>

                    <p>Who vs. Whom</p>
                    <p>This distinction is rapidly falling out of use, but a tip about how to remember the different usages might come in handy.</p>
                    <p>If you would say <q>him,</q> <q>her,</q> or <q>them,</q> then you should use whom. If you would say <q>he,</q> <q>she,</q> or <q>they,</q> then use who.</p>
                    <p>
                        Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><q>I am speaking to her.</q> → <q>To whom am I speaking?</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>She called.</q> → <q>Who called?</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>I envy him.</q> → <q>He's the person whom I envy.</q></p></li>

                    <p>Fewer vs. Less</p>
                    <p>This one is simple! If you can count it, use <q>fewer.</q> If you can't count it, use <q>less.</q></p>
                    <p>
                        Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><q>I want fewer homework assignments.</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>I want less homework.</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>I want fewer cartons of milk.</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>I want less milk.</q></p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Who's vs. Whose</p>
                    <p>Possessives in English are the worst! <q>Who's</q> seems like it would denote possession because it has an apostrophe, which is how we usually indicate that someone has something (with the exception of possessive pronouns like hers, his, theirs, and yours, of course<ellipsis/>). But, unfortunately, <q>who's</q> is a contraction of <q>who is</q> or <q>who has</q> and it has nothing to do with possession.</p>
                    <p>
                        Examples:

                            <li><p><q>Who's that over there?</q> → <q>Who is that over there?</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>She's the one who's been helping me.</q> → <q>She is the one who has been helping me.</q></p></li>

                    </p>
                    <p><q>Whose,</q> on the other hand, indicates that someone, <q>who,</q> possesses something. If you're a fan of early 2000s American comedy, you might use <em>Whose Line is it Anyway?</em> as a mnemonic device.</p>
                    <p>
                        Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><q>Whose baby is that?</q> → <q>To whom does that baby belong?</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>My friend, whose bike was stolen, decided to buy a U-lock.</q> → <q>My friend, who possessed a bike that was stolen, decided to buy a U-lock.</q></p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Speaking of possessive pronouns<ellipsis/></p>
                    <p>Similarly to <q>who's</q> looking like the possessive version of <q>who,</q> the possessive versions of the pronouns <q>it, him, her, your, their, and our</q> can be misleading. Although the apostrophe (it's, her's, your's, their's, and our's) is tempting to include, leave it out! The correct possessive pronouns are: its, his, hers, yours, theirs, and ours.</p>

                    <p>Where do commas and periods go when you're using quotation marks?</p>
                    <p>In <xref ref="SAE" text="title"/>, commas and periods go inside <q>quotation marks.</q> The exception to this guideline is for some citation styles, like MLA, which <q>look like this</q> (page number).</p>
