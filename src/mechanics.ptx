    <title>Writing at the Sentence Level</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>Although some people are willing to express their undying love for grammar via sonnet, most people find sentence<ndash/>level mechanics daunting, overwhelming, confusing, and sometimes (gasp!) boring. Just the sight of sentence diagrams sends some people straight back to their seventh<ndash/>grade English class and provokes tears of frustration. There are multitudes of components, hordes of definitions, and seemingly endless numbers of terms. How can anyone keep them all straight?!</p>
        <p>Fear not. The good news is that you've had a miraculous understanding of English grammar (or the grammar of whatever your first language may be) since the time you learned to ask for more Cheerios. Your babbles as a baby, simple sentences as a toddler, and recent rap battles with friends have all prepared you to understand, work with, and manipulate language in complicated and ingenious ways. You're already so cool!</p>

        <introduction>
            <p>The purpose of this section is to help elucidate why you can understand the sentence you're currently reading (What parts does it contain? What do those parts mean?). We hope to lay out completely yet concisely all of the sentence<ndash/>level basics with which you should be familiar. Let's get started (don't worry<mdash/>we'll ease into it)!</p>

            <title>Parts of Speech</title>
            <p>Each word in a sentence belongs to a part of speech. There are eight parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. Words can belong to multiple parts of speech, depending on how they're being used. By being able to identify the part of speech a word falls into, you can better understand the underlying forms and meanings of a sentence.</p>

            <title>Basic Sentence Structure</title>
            <subsubsection xml:id="subject-predicate">
                <title>Subject<ndash/>Predicate</title>
                <p>In <xref ref="SAE" text="title"/> (<init>SAE</init>), a basic sentence is composed of two parts: the subject and the predicate. The <term>subject<idx>subject</idx></term> of a sentence is the person or entity that does an action or is the main focus of the sentence. The subject may be a <xref ref="definition-noun"/>, proper noun, personal <xref ref="definition-pronoun"/>, <xref ref="definition-noun-phrases"/>, or different nouns linked by a <xref ref="definition-conjunction"/>. The <term>predicate<idx>predicate</idx></term> is the action or description of the subject. The predicate may be a <xref ref="definition-verb"/>, a verb accompanied by helping verbs, or an entire verb phrase. For instance, in the sentence <q>The first<ndash/>year student waited in line for the Farm<ndash/>to<ndash/>Table special,</q> the noun phrase <q>the first<ndash/>year student</q> would be the subject and <q>waited in line for the Farm<ndash/>to<ndash/>Table special</q> would be the predicate. An easy way to distinguish the subject and predicate of a sentence is to 1) ask yourself what is <q>being done</q> (predicate), and then 2) ask yourself <q>what</q> is doing that action (subject).</p>
                <example>
                    <title>Subject<ndash/>Predicate: Sample Sentences</title>
                    <p>
                        Below you can find a few example sentences showing the subject (<em>italicized</em>) and predicate (regular typeface):
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><em>Ollie</em> studied in Diversions.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>The IPE professor</em> told the class to turn the assignment in on Moodle.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>The a capella group <q>What She Said</q></em> will perform at the spring concert.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </example>
            </subsubsection>
            <subsubsection xml:id="direct-indirect-objects">
                <title>Direct and Indirect Objects</title>
                <p>A complete sentence always has a <xref ref="definition-subject"/> and a <xref ref="definition-predicate"/>. A predicate can include both direct and indirect objects.</p>
                <p>A <term>direct object<idx>direct object</idx></term> is the noun on which the action occurs. In the sentence, <q>You bought a present,</q> <em><q>the present</q></em> is the direct object because it is the noun on which the action <em><q>bought</q></em> occurs.</p>
                <p>An <term>indirect object<idx>indirect object</idx></term> is the secondary object, or the object secondarily affected by the action, which is to say that a sentence can only have an indirect object if it also has a direct object. An indirect object is either explicitly or implicitly prepositional. In the sentence, <q>You bought a present for me,</q> <em><q>me</q></em> is the indirect object because it is the recipient of the object originally acted on. In this case, it is marked by the preposition <em><q>for.</q></em> The sentence could also be constructed <q>You bought me a present.</q> Here, the direct and indirect objects are the same, only the indirect object is not indicated by the preposition <em><q>for.</q></em> An easy way to identify the direct and indirect object of a sentence is to ask yourself: On what is the action occurring? (This is the direct object.) And what is being affected by the action having already occurred on something else? (This is the indirect object.)</p>

                <title>Clauses</title>
                <p>What do clauses and amino acids have in common? They're both essential building blocks! Just as amino acids make life possible, clauses make sentences possible. As you read in the previous section, every clause is composed of a <xref ref="definition-subject"/> and a <xref ref="definition-predicate"/>, <em>which also means that every clause has a <xref ref="definition-noun"/> and a <xref ref="definition-verb"/>.</em> Unfortunately, like many things in English, there are far too many terms that make it difficult to keep the concepts straight.</p>

                <title>Phrases</title>
                <p>Phrases are to sentences what landscaping is to Puget Sound. Just as Puget Sound's landscaping makes the campus beautiful, interesting, and informative, so too do phrases add beauty, interest, and information to sentences. Like clauses and almost everything else grammar related, though, there are far too many phrases with overly confusing names. To remember and understand each type of phrase, it might be helpful for you to review <xref ref="eight-parts-of-speech"/>. Since phrases function as single parts of speech, you can figure out which type of phrase a particular phrase is by identifying its role in a sentence.</p>
                <note>
                    <title>Distinguishing a Phrase from a Clause</title>
                    <p>Whereas a clause has both a <xref ref="definition-noun"/> <em>and</em> a <xref ref="definition-verb"/>, a phrase has either a noun <em>or</em> a verb, but <em>not both</em>. Phrases are groups of words that function as a single part of speech (<eg/>, a noun or an <xref ref="definition-adjective"/>).</p>

                            <p>Remember that a <xref ref="definition-preposition"/> tells you the timing or placement of a noun. A <term>prepositional phrase<idx>prepositional phrase</idx></term>, then, is a phrase that tells you about the timing or placement of another part of the sentence. Prepositional phrases function as either adjectives (to modify a noun, as in <q>The cat on the bed</q>) or as adverbs (to modify a verb as in <q>The cat jumped off the bed</q>).</p>
                            <p><q>That cat is <em>under the table</em>.</q></p>

                <title>Modifiers</title>
                <p>A <term>modifier<idx>modifier</idx></term> is a word, phrase, or clause that characterizes a noun and is typically used to add description or specificity to a sentence. You can identify the modifier in a sentence by asking yourself which or what kind of noun the sentence is highlighting. For example, in the sentence <q>The students gazed in awe at the towering sequoia tree,</q> the word <q>towering</q> is being used to modify or describe the sequoia tree. Therefore, to identify the modifier, you can ask yourself <q>Which sequoia tree?</q> and answer <q>The towering one.</q></p>
                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Participial Phrase as Modifier</title>
                    <p>A <xref ref="definition-participial-phrases"/> can also act as a <xref ref="definition-modifier"/>. For instance, in the sentence <q>Gazing at the towering sequoia tree, the students were in awe,</q> the phrase <q>gazing at the towering sequoia tree</q> is the modifier describing the students. You can play the same game as before: <q>Which students were in awe?</q> <q>The ones gazing at the towering sequoia tree.</q></p>

                    <p>An <xref ref="definition-adjective-clause"/> can act as another type of <xref ref="definition-modifier"/>. In the sentence <q>The sequoia tree, which was towering over the students, inspired widespread awe,</q> the clause <q>which was towering over the students</q> is the modifier describing the sequoia tree. Again: <q>What kind of sequoia tree?</q> <q>The one towering over the students.</q></p>

                <title>Types of Sentences</title>
                <p>Sentence structure is important to keep in mind while you're writing because strong writing typically employs sentences of varied type and length. Writers can also strategically use certain sentence structures to convey meaning to a reader beyond the meaning of the words alone. If you realize that you mostly utilize one or two sentence types, try mixing up your sentence structures a bit more!</p>

                <title>Subordination and Coordination</title>
                <p>Because each <xref ref="definition-clause"/> in a <xref ref="definition-compound-sentence"/> is independent, neither one is obviously backgrounded in relation to the other (as in a <xref ref="definition-complex-sentence"/>). That's because the relation between the clauses of a compound sentence is only conveyed lexically (through the <xref ref="definition-conjunction-coordinating"/>), as opposed to lexically and syntactically (in a complex sentence). Nonetheless, a compound sentence can serve various purposes. A compound sentence that conjoins clauses using <em><q>and</q></em> can provide extra information (<q>I want to go to the park and I want to search for Pokemon</q>). A compound sentence that conjoins clauses using <em><q>or</q></em> or <em><q>nor</q></em> can provide alternatives (<q>I want to go to the park or I want to stay home and play Pokemon</q>). A compound sentence that conjoins clauses using <em><q>so</q></em> or <em><q>for</q></em> can provide justification (<q>I want to go to the park so I can search for Pokemon; I want to go to the park for I love to search for Pokemon</q>).</p>
                <p>As its name implies, a <xref ref="definition-dependent-clause"/> must always be subordinated to the <xref ref="definition-independent-clause"/>independent clause in a <xref ref="definition-complex-sentence"/>. The effect of this subordination is the backgrounding of the subordinate clause and the foregrounding of the independent clause. In the example <q>When the <acro>SUB</acro> runs out of hummus, I want to cry,</q> the subordinate clause <q>When the <acro>SUB</acro> runs out of hummus</q> is backgrounded in relation to the independent clause <q>I want to cry.</q> This relativization places different emphasis on the clauses. The independent clause <q>I want to cry</q> is more important than the subordinate clause <q>When the <acro>SUB</acro> runs out of hummus</q> because it conveys a complete thought, while the subordinate clause only modifies that thought. As the backgrounded clause, the subordinate clause specifies the context (provides the background) of the independent clause. The picture would be coherent without the background, but not nearly as robust. When constructing a complex sentence, then, consider what the most important part of that sentence is and foreground it.</p>

                    <p> A <xref ref="definition-compound-sentence"/> can easily be transformed into a <xref ref="definition-complex-sentence"/>. For instance, the example <q>I miss my high school friends, but I'm excited to make new friends.</q> could be reconstructed to read <q>Although I miss my high school friends, I'm excited to make new friends.</q> Consider what meaning you want to convey in your sentence and construct them accordingly.</p>

            <title>Grammar of Infinitives</title>
            <introduction>
                <p><term>Infinitives<idx>infinitives</idx></term> are verb forms composed of two words, such as <q>to write</q> or <q>to understand.</q> For instance, <q>I like to write sentences using infinitives</q> and <q>To understand infinitives, one should learn when to use them,</q> are examples of the infinitive verb form.</p>
                <p>But say you wanted to make these sentences a bit more descriptive. You can do this by adding an <xref ref="definition-adverb"/> or adverbial phrase to the verb forms, such as <q>clearly write</q> or <q>fully understand.</q> This may result in <q>splitting the infinitive,</q> where adverbs or adverbial phrases are inserted between the <q>to</q> and the root verb that follows, as in <q>to clearly write</q> or <q>to fully understand.</q> Split infinitives are hotly contested in the grammar world. Some grammarians argue we should always avoid splitting our infinitives while others assert splitting the infinitive isn't a hard rule and can be done if it preserves thought and sentence fluency. Therefore, it's hard to know when to avoid splitting an infinitive and when it's all right to leave it as is. Below are a few guidelines to help you decide whether or not to split your infinitives (infinitive verb forms are <un s="1">underlined</un>, adverbs are <em>italicized</em>).</p>
            </introduction>
            <subsubsection xml:id="when-to-split-infinitives">
                <title>When to Split Infinitives</title>
                <p>Sometimes the sentence meaning is clearer when the adverb modifying the verb stays within the verb form. For instance, consider the sentences below:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I like <un s="1">to</un> <em>clearly</em> <un s="1">write</un> sentences using infinitives.</q></p>
                    <p><q><un s="1">To</un> <em>fully</em> <un s="1">understand</un> infinitives, one should learn when to use them.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Both of these sentences have split infinitives (<q>to clearly write</q> and <q>to fully understand</q>). However, if we move the adverbs outside of the verb form, suddenly the sentences become less clear and more awkward:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I like <un s="1">to write</un> sentences <em>clearly</em> using infinitives.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, it is not clear whether <q>clearly</q> is modifying <q>to write</q> or <q>using infinitives</q>; does the person like to clearly write or clearly use infinitives? In this case, it might be better to leave the modifying adverb within the verb form.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q><un s="1">To understand</un> infinitives <em>fully</em>, one should learn when to use them.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, the modifying adverb <q>fully</q> is placed outside of the verb form <q>to understand.</q> While this placement does not interfere with the meaning or fluency of the sentence, it breaks up the logical unit of thought; one must refer back to the intact verb form <q>to understand</q> in order to identify what <q>fully</q> is modifying. Therefore, it might be better to split the infinitive so the reader has a clearer idea of what kind of understanding the sentence is promising (full understanding).</p>

                <title>When not to Split Infinitives</title>
                <p>While splitting the infinitive is sometimes necessary to preserve sentence fluency and thought coherency, it is usually better to avoid splitting them when you can. Infinitives are single units of thought, so keeping them intact often improves the reader's understanding of the sentence. Additionally, splitting the infinitive can actually make the sentence more awkward. For instance, take the following sentences where the infinitives are intact:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>You should try <un s="1">to keep</un> infinitives intact <em>whenever possible</em>.</q></p>
                    <p><q>I would like <un s="1">to write</un> sentences with infinitives <em>clearly and concisely</em>.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Both of these sentences keep the infinitive intact (<q>to keep</q> and <q>to write</q>). But say you tried to split the infinitives:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>You should try <un s="1">to</un> <em>whenever possible</em> <un s="1">keep</un> infinitives intact.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, inserting the modifier <q>whenever possible</q> between the verb form makes the sentence awkward and unwieldy. In this case, keeping the infinitive <q>to keep</q> intact makes the sentence more readable and clear.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I would like <un s="1">to</un> <em>clearly and concisely</em> <un s="1">write</un> sentences with infinitives.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Similarly, the infinitive verb form <q>to write</q> in this sentence is split by the modifying phrase <q>clearly and concisely.</q> In this case, splitting the infinitive with the modifier disrupts sentence fluency and expression of the verb form <q>to write</q>; therefore, it's probably better to keep the infinitive phrase intact.</p>

                <p>As we have seen, <xref ref="definition-subject">subjects</xref> and <xref ref="definition-verb">verbs</xref> (predicates) are the primary components of any sentence. Therefore, it is important that they <q>agree,</q> or match each other in terms of plurality. In other words, single subjects require singular verbs, and plural subjects require plural verbs. For instance, in <init>SAE</init>, you wouldn't say <q>Amanda <em>jog</em> to the field house,</q> but rather <q>Amanda <em>jogs</em> to the field house.</q> Similarly, if the subject is plural, you would change the verb accordingly: <q>The soccer players <em>is</em> tired</q> would become <q>The soccer players <em>are</em> tired.</q> Use the following guidelines to help you figure out if the subject and verb of your sentence <q>agree.</q></p>

                <title>Pronoun<ndash/>Antecedent Agreement</title>
                <p>Problems with agreement occur most commonly when a writer mentions a <xref ref="definition-subject"/>, a movie director, for example, and then uses a <xref ref="definition-pronoun"/> to refer back to that subject. When the subject's gender is unspecified, it is unclear whether the subject (in this case, the director) should be referred to as <q>he</q> or <q>she.</q> Because the plural pronoun <q>they</q> is gender<ndash/>neutral, many writers, consciously or not, opt to use <q>they</q> instead of <q>he,</q> <q>she,</q> or the more cumbersome phrase <q>he or she.</q> (see <xref ref="basic-sentence-structure" text="title"/>)</p>
                <p>A sentence using <q>they</q> but referring to a singular pronoun looks like this:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>I liked what the director of the movie did. They did a good job.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In terms of grammatical correctness, formal, standard English requires writers to make the correct agreement between a pronoun and its antecedent (<ie/>, you have to use singular pronouns for singular antecedents). For a gender<ndash/>unspecified singular antecedent, then, a writer has a few options: to use the phrase <q>he or she,</q> to make the subject plural if possible, or to avoid the issue altogether by restructuring the sentence. A sentence of this sort would therefore take one of these three forms:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>I liked what the director of the movie did. He or she did a good job.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>That movie had a good director. When directors pay special attention to lighting like this director did, they are doing a good job.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>That movie was great! I can't believe how well the director focused on light!</q></p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More conservative grammarians may insist that these are the only ways to refer to a single person of unspecified gender. Language is always changing, however, and today English is slowly being reclaimed by some groups it has historically been used to subjugate, including women and individuals who do not conform to the gender binary (see <xref ref="SAE"/>). These shifts explain why it is now inappropriate to use <q>he</q> as the default pronoun and why <q>they</q> is becoming increasingly accepted as a gender–neutral, third–person singular pronoun (see <xref ref="pronoun-identity"/>).</p>

            <title>Indefinite Pronouns</title>
                <p>Indefinite <xref ref="definition-pronoun">pronouns</xref> do not refer to any particular person or thing, and it is not always obvious whether they are singular or plural, which can make subject-verb agreement a bit tricky.Many indefinite pronouns (<eg/>, anyone, everyone, everybody, someone, no one, nobody) are singular and should be accompanied by a singular <xref ref="definition-verb"/> (<ndash/>s ending or <q>is</q>/<q>has</q>).</p>

                </example>
                <p><q>Each</q> is a singular <xref ref="definition-pronoun"/> and requires a singular <xref ref="definition-verb"/>. Therefore, even if the subject of the sentence is plural, <q>each</q> refers to every single member of that group and should be treated as a singular pronoun.</p>

                <example>
                    <title>All as a Pronoun: Grass is Greener</title>

                    Sometimes the <xref ref="definition-subject"/> and <xref ref="definition-verb"/> are separated by modifying phrases and <xref ref="definition-adjective">adjectives</xref> that describe the subject. While <xref ref="definition-modifier">modifiers</xref> are useful for adding specificity to sentences, they can be confusing when you are trying to make your subject and verb agree. If you spot a modifier, skip over it and make your verb singular or plural based on the subject. In the following examples, subjects are underlined and verbs are italicised.

                <p>There are some <xref ref="definition-subject">subjects</xref> that may be singular or plural depending on how you use them.</p>
                <p>In order to determine whether to use a singular or a plural <xref ref="definition-verb"/>, ask yourself: Are the people in the group acting as a single unit, or is each individual in the group acting individually? If the group is acting as a single unit, use singular. If each individual in the group is acting individually, use plural. (To help with the plural instances, try seeing if it would make sense to write <q><fillin/> members,</q> like <q>jury members</q> or <q>council members.</q>)</p>

            <title>Problems with Parallelism</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>Parallel sentence structure is a common pattern used to illustrate two or more ideas, items, or phrases that are equally emphasized in a sentence. It's helpful to use parallel structure when you want to include a list of something or apply a series of words, phrases, or clauses to the same adjective or pronoun. This condenses the sentence, making it more efficient and less repetitive. For instance, say Polly likes to do three things. One way of listing those three things would be to write, <q>Polly likes to read books, likes to drink coffee, and likes to pet cats.</q> But that's a pretty tedious sentence. Instead, you could use parallel structure to condense the sentence: <q>Polly likes to read books, drink coffee, and pet cats.</q> In this sentence, <q>likes to</q> applies equally to the infinitive phrases <q>read books,</q> <q>drink coffee,</q> and <q>pet cats.</q></p>
                <p>However, sometimes it's easy to lose yourself while using parallel sentence structure by being inconsistent with your word, phrase, or clause forms. For instance, consider this common incorrect rewriting of the above sentence: <q>Polly likes to read books, drink coffee, and petting cats.</q> This is incorrect parallel sentence structure because the word forms are not the same; <q>likes to</q> applies to reading books and drinking coffee, but not to petting cats because the verb <q>petting</q> takes care of itself. The sentence indicates that Polly <q>likes to read books,</q> <q>likes to drink coffee,</q> and <q>likes to petting cats,</q> which has too many active verbs (<q>likes to</q> and <q>petting</q>). By replacing the infinitive form of <q>to pet</q> with the gerund form <q>petting,</q> the sentence now doesn't make very much sense. Sometimes inconsistent forms can be tricky to identify, especially when you have a series of complex clauses or phrases. Below are some common examples of parallel structure errors to watch out for.</p>
            </introduction>
            <subsubsection xml:id="parallelism-mixing-word-forms">
                <title>Mixing Word Forms</title>
                <p>The above sentence is an example of mixing word forms (to read, to drink, and petting). If you have a verb that applies to two or more of the items in the series, it must apply to all items equally in order to preserve correct parallel structure. Take the following example of mixing word forms:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Oppenheimer is a relaxing place to study; it is calm, quiet, and has lots of windows.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, the attributes <q>calm</q> and <q>quiet</q> equally share the verb <q>is</q>: Oppenheimer <q>is calm</q> and <q>is quiet.</q> However, the last attribute in the series (<q>has lots of windows</q>), departs from this structure by introducing another verb, <q>has,</q> to characterize the attribute <q>lots of windows,</q> throwing the series out of balance. If <q>is</q> is applied equally to each attribute, Oppenheimer <q>is calm,</q> <q>is quiet,</q> and <q>is has lots of windows.</q> To fix this mixed word form, you must do one of two things: 1) either break up the attributes into two different items using the conjunction <q>and</q> or 2) arrange the attributes so they share a single verb and adhere to the parallel structure.</p>
                <p>
                    Examples of these fixes are shown below:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Oppenheimer is a relaxing place to study; it is calm and quiet and has lots of windows.</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>Oppenheimer is a relaxing place to study; it is calm, quiet, and airy.</q></p></li>
                    </ul>

                <p>The same rule may be applied to a series of complex clauses. If you have a verb that applies to two or more clauses in the series, it must apply equally to all clauses in order to maintain parallel structure. Take the following example of mixing clause forms:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Diversions has cut a lot of paper waste by offering mug discounts, free Cup Karma drinks, more <q>for<ndash/>here</q> options, and by encouraging people to recycle their coffee cup lids and sleeves.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, Diversions has cut a lot of waste by doing two things: 1) offering mug discounts, free Cup Karma drinks, and more <q>for<ndash/>here</q> options and 2) encouraging people to recycle. While the first three clauses in the series (discounts, drinks, and options) all share the verb <q>offering</q> equally, the fourth clause (recycling lids and sleeves) only uses the verb <q>encouraging.</q> To correct this sentence to preserve parallel structure, you have to insert the conjunction <q>and</q> between the second and third clauses to distinguish what Diversions is <q>offering</q> from what it is <q>encouraging.</q> Take the corrected revision:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>Diversions has cut a lot of paper waste by offering mug discounts, free Cup Karma drinks, and more <q>for<ndash/>here</q> options and by encouraging people to recycle their coffee cup lids and sleeves.</q></p>

                <title>Two Nouns Following One Adjective</title>
                <p>When you have two or more nouns following an adjective, that adjective must apply to all nouns equally. This can be a tricky mistake to identify; when we read, we often only think to apply the adjective to the noun that immediately follows it in the sentence. However, it's important to make sure that either all nouns share the same adjective equally or each noun has its own adjective in a series. Take the following example of an adjective that is incorrectly applied to both nouns:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>The Cellar's rambunctious atmosphere and array of ice cream flavors make it a good place to go to unwind.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This sentence indicates that the adjective <q>rambunctious</q> applies to both <q>atmosphere</q> and <q>array of ice cream flavors.</q> While the first association makes sense, it would be strange to describe an array of ice cream flavors as <q>rambunctious.</q> Instead, both nouns must either share an adjective that describes both of them or they must have their own adjectives.</p>
                <p>
                    To fix this sentence, you can do one of two things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>add an adjective that applies to <q>array of ice cream flavors</q></p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>The Cellar's rambunctious atmosphere and diverse array of ice cream flavors make it a good place to go to unwind.</q></p>

                        <li>
                            <p>repeat the pronoun before <q>array</q> to prevent the misperception that it is a <q>rambunctious array</q></p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p><q>The Cellar's rambunctious atmosphere and its array of ice cream flavors make it a good place to go to unwind.</q></p>

                <title>Lists After a Colon</title>
                <p>When you have a list after a colon, the parallel structure rule should be equally applied to all items in that list. Take this example of a list that does not follow parallel structure:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>The sandwich station at the <acro>SUB</acro> has the following spread options: hummus, pesto, mayo, mustard, and it also has relish.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This list breaks parallel structure with the last item, <q>it also has relish,</q> which adds both a subject (<q>it</q>) and verb (<q>has</q>) to the list item (<q>relish</q>). To make this sentence adhere to parallel structure, the list item must be in the same form as the other items in the list:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>The sandwich station at the <acro>SUB</acro> has the following spread options: hummus, pesto, mayo, mustard, and relish.</q></p>
                </blockquote>

These <term>misplaced modifiers<idx>misplaced modifiers</idx></term> not only make the sentence confusing to read; they also may actually end up describing something they're not supposed to describe.

                <p>In this sentence, <q>towering above the heads of the students</q> is a participial phrase (see <xref ref="definition-participial-phrases" text="title"/>). However, it's currently being used to describe the pronoun <q>we.</q> Unless <q>we</q> are giants, this sentence doesn't make much sense; how can <q>we</q> tower above the heads of students?

                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>We gazed in awe up at the sequoia tree towering above the heads of the students.</q></p>

                <p>Having noticed that a great number of professors wax loquacious when giving lectures, you may be perplexed to learn that academics actually value brevity in academic writing. Professors face some of the same challenges that you probably face in college: they have a lot of reading to do, what they’re reading is specific and hard to understand, and they have to write about it themselves. From this predicament emerges the importance of writing precisely and clearly, choosing words carefully, being wary of passive voice, and packing meaning into a sentence by using colorful, strong verbs. In this section, you will learn to make intentional decisions about your writing style and word choice to enrich your essays.</p>

Not necessarily! If more words and specialized vocabulary will make your meaning more clear to a specific audience, then it's worth it to use longer, more complex wording. But if complicated language makes the sentence (and your point) more confusing, it's better to state your ideas simply.</p>

                <p>You can also simply restructure the sentence(s) to avoid using <q>this</q> as the subject. From the example above, I could also say, <q>Chuck likes to take walks, so I walk him every day.</q> Finally, you can think of a noun that tells your reader what <q>this</q> is referring to: <em>this</em> quote, <em>this</em> information, <em>this</em> verdict, <em>this</em> distinction, <em>this</em> occurrence, <em>this</em> sentiment, <etc/></p>

                <p>Incorrect word choice usually occurs when a writer uses a word outside of its standard definition or context. This misuse can happen for a variety of reasons, including the writer having a wrong mental definition of the word, not knowing the word's popular connotation, or using the word in an inappropriate disciplinary context.</p>

                        <p>When writing in a specific discipline, it can be difficult to know what words are specific to that discipline and how they are used differently in academic writing than they are in standard, every day conversation. In statistics, for example, <em><q>significant</q></em> has a very specific meaning (<ie/>, having statistical importance), and any other uses of the word are incorrect and generally avoided. Similarly, <em><q>conjugation</q></em> has a very different meaning in biology than it does in Spanish. You can't avoid every mistake, but professors can help guide you. Reading scholarly work in a discipline you're studying is also an invaluable tool for learning that discipline's jargon and linguistic preferences.</p>

                <title>Ineffective Word Choice</title>
                <p>While academic writing usually employs more abstruse and sophisticated language than you find in every day conversation, sometimes using <q>big words</q> simply to sound smart can come across to an audience as pedantic. Words that are overly complicated and obfuscate the meaning of a sentence are therefore ineffective; if the point of writing is to convey meaning clearly, a confusing word should not get in the way of that meaning.</p>
                <p><em>Alternatively, using words or phrases that are too simplistic, overused, or trite can also ineffectively convey meaning to a reader.</em> Passive sentences, phrases constructed around <q>to be,</q> and clichés like <q>to be honest</q> all diminish the point you're trying to convey to a reader.</p>

                <p>Compare the following two sentences:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><q>To be honest, I didn't think that Hamlet was played by the right actor.</q></p>
                    <p><q>The actor who played Hamlet fell five times on stage, broke poor Yorick's skull, and forgot his lines during the <q>To be, or not to be<ellipsis/></q> speech. The directors of the play should have chosen a better actor to play Hamlet.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The first sentence isn't <em>bad,</em> but the second sentences uses specific verbs that are widely known to paint a rich picture about why the actor who played Hamlet should get the hook.</p>

                <title>Strategies for Identifying Passive Voice</title>
                <introduction>
                <p>Below are some ways you can identify the passive voice. Please note that these tips are general guidelines, not concrete characteristics of every instance of passive voice.</p>
                </introduction>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>Look for <q>to be</q> verbs.</em></p>
                        <p>The passive voice is often constructed in this format: <em><q>to be</q> + past participle.</em> Notice that the previous sentence is passive. It has <q>is</q> as the form of <q>to be</q> and <q>constructed</q> as the past participle.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>Look for <q>by</q> + a noun/pronoun/proper noun.</em></p>
                        <p>As with the example <q>Barbara was hugged by Sally,</q> passive sentences often use the word <q>by</q> to show that someone or something carried out the action. Barbara wasn't <em>just</em> hugged, she was hugged <em>by Sally.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>Check out an example: <xref ref="example-mechanics-juxtaposing-ap"/></em></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </list>
            <p>While the passive voice is not grammatically incorrect, most readers (and professors) prefer the active voice because readers generally want to identify the action happening in a piece of writing. Since the active voice makes it easier to identify what is happening and who or what is acting, the active voice usually makes more sense as a writing style. Similarly, the active voice also clarifies the meaning of and give more details about a sentence.</p>
            <example xml:id="example-mechanics-juxtaposing-ap">
                <title>Juxtaposing Passive and Active Voice</title>
                <p>Consider these two sentences:
                    <dl>
                        <li>
                            <title>Passive</title>
                            <p><q>We were asked by the flight attendant to have our luggage put in the overhead compartment by a man next to us who went by the name of Jim.</q></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <title>Active</title>
                            <p><q>The flight attendant asked us to have Jim, the man sitting next to us, put our luggage in the overhead compartment.</q></p>
                        </li>
                    </dl>
                    In both examples, there are three main people: us (the writer), the flight attendant, and Jim. The first example, the one in the passive voice, becomes long and confusing. The reader will have forgotten who asked whom to do what by the time Jim's name comes up. The second example, however, more clearly explains the scenario because there is less confusion about who is doing what.
                </p>
            </example>
            <note>
                <p>The large exception to these preferences is science. Most scientific work tends to be written in the passive voice. An active version of the previous sentence would be, <q>Most scientists tend to write in the passive voice.</q> Notice how the first version, the passive one, takes the actor out of the sentence completely. Who does the passive writing in the sciences? The active version answers that question: scientists write in the passive voice in science writing. Sciences tend to use the passive voice to distance the scientist from the science being done. The passive voice is therefore used strategically by the sciences. (Again, the previous sentence could also be active: <q>The sciences (or scientists) therefore use the passive voice strategically.</q>)</p>

            <p>While we use <q>to be</q> frequently in our every day speech, the verb is often too weak as the main verb in formal writing. Uses of <q>to be</q> include: <em>to be, being, am, is, are, was, and were.</em></p>

            <introduction>
                <p><term>Homophones<idx>homophones</idx></term> are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings. Because homophones share the same pronunciations (or sound similar), they are commonly confused in writing, especially when you know the spelling of one homophone but intend to convey the other. Below is a list of commonly confused homophones and some example sentences using them. But if you are unsure of a word and it's not listed here, try looking it up in a dictionary or thesaurus to make sure it's the word you want!</p>

                <p>One of the more common homophone errors writers make is between <q>its</q> and <q>it's.</q> While they sound the same, <q>its</q> is the possessive pronoun of <q>it</q> and <q>it's</q> is the contraction of <q>it is.</q> One way to differentiate them is to identify why you are using one version or the other. <q>Its</q> is used to convey possession by an inanimate object, action, idea, animal, group, or person whose gender is overlooked, as in the sentence <q>The dog bounded happily toward its owner on Todd Field.</q> <q>It's</q> with an apostrophe is used to indicate <q>it is</q> or the past tense <q>it was,</q> as in the sentences <q>It's [it is] a universally acknowledged belief that a dog is a human's best friend,</q> or <q>It's [it has] been great getting to know all the dogs that frequent campus.</q> If you are trying to figure out which form to use, try splitting <q>its</q> into <q>it is</q> or <q>it was</q> and see if the sentence still makes sense. For instance, the sentence <q>The dog bounded happily toward it is owner on Todd Field,</q> does not make very much sense, so this may be an indication that the correct form to use is <q>its.</q></p>
                <p>Below are some sentence examples of <q>its</q> and <q>it's</q> to help you distinguish which form to use.</p>

                    <p>It's important to remember that contractions (such as <q>it's</q>) are informal and generally not appropriate in academia and should rarely be used in formal academic writing (such as lab reports, analytical essays, <etc/>). HOWEVER: the use of <q>it's</q> depends on the discipline, professor, writing assignment, and your own creative and scholarly voice, so don't be afraid to employ it intentionally as you see fit.</p>

            <p>How to punctuate a sentence and when to capitalize a word are especially challenging decisions to make because of the vast number of rules and exceptions to rules that govern when to capitalization and punctuation, not to mention the fact that there are some rules that are contested (ever heard of an Oxford comma?). In this section, you won’t find <em>every</em> rule concerning capitalization and punctuation, but if you learn the rules here (which are all frequently relevant), you will be prepared to answer the majority of questions that you will have while writing.</p>

                <p>The <em>en dash</em> (also known as a hyphen). This dash is the dash that appears when you hit the dash key once. You can use it to hyphenate words (like in<ndash/>depth) or to show a range (1894<ndash/>1904 or numbers 1<ndash/>5).</p>
                <p>The <em>em dash</em> (also known as a dash). Make an em dash by hitting the dash key twice<mdash/>like this! These longer dashes are what you use to set things apart<mdash/>you can use them with fragments or complete sentences.

                <p>Aside from citations (see <xref ref="citations"/>), parentheses are used in writing to separate words, phrases, or sentences from the main text. When you want to add additional information that doesn't fit well within the main part of a sentence, you can use parentheses to inform your reader while simultaneously keeping your sentence flowing (like this). (Or you can just use parentheses on their own to indicate that something is an aside or afterthought.) For more details on how to use other types of punctuation with parentheses (<eg/>, where does the period go?!), see <xref ref="period-inside-or-outside"/>!</p>
                <p>You can also use parentheses in area codes, like (253) 879<ndash/>3404 (which is, coincidentally, the phone number to the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching [<init>CWLT</init>]).</p>

                    Brackets are kind of weird and don't seem to come up much, but, in general, you can associate them with quoted or parenthetical material. You should use brackets when you:

                        <li>
                            <p>include a quote that requires clarification to make sense.</p>

                            <p><q>[T]hey are the best,</q> Shelly said about her roommates.</p>
                            <p>Shelly loved her roommates last year; she said <q>they [were] the best.</q> (Here, we've changed the present tense <q>are</q> to the past tense <q>were</q> in order to match the tense of the sentence.)</p>

                <title>Quotation Marks</title>
                <p>When you quote something, you are exactly replicating the words, phrases, and sentences of another source. Therefore, whenever you are quoting something directly, it's always a good idea to make sure you copy the quotation exactly as it appears in the source. Otherwise, you're inadvertently changing what the quote is saying! But sometimes when you write longer and more complicated quotes, you may forget to insert commas or emphases, type a wrong word, or end the quote incorrectly. Besides simply trying to copy the quote exactly, there are a few other guidelines to keep in mind while incorporating quotes into your writing.</p>

                            <p>All quotes require two sets of quotation marks, one set signifying the beginning of the quote and the other signifying the end. Therefore, whenever you use one set of quotations, be sure you follow them up with a second set at the end of the quote. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-using-quotations"/> for an example.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>In order to introduce your quote to the reader, place a comma after the dialogue tag or introductory phrase that comes before your quote. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-prefacing-quotations"/> for an example.</p>

                            <p><em>Capitalize the quoted sentence.</em></p>
                            <p>If you are quoting a complete sentence, capitalize the first letter of the quoted sentence. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-capitalizing-quoted"/> for an example.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>If you are ending your sentence with a quoted sentence, end the quote with a period, exclamation point, or ellipsis before the final set of quotation marks. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-integrating-quotes"/> for an example.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Integrate your quotes into the grammar of your sentence.</em></p>
                            <p>If you are breaking your quoted sentence into two parts, end the first part with a comma and do not capitalize the second part. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-ellipses-replacing"/> for an example.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Use an ellipsis to replace omitted source material.</em></p>
                            <p>Sometimes the information you want to quote will be near the beginning or end of a long sentence or passage, but the material in between may not be applicable or useful to you. If this is the case, you can use an ellipsis (<ellipsis/>) to replace the material you are omitting. However, it's important that the material you are replacing does not change the meaning or intent of the source material.</p>
                            <p>Because any quote comes from a larger context, an ellipsis is only needed at the beginning or end of a quote if it would appear otherwise that the entire sentence was quoted. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-ellipses-honestly"/> for an example.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Use brackets to indicate non<ndash/>standard elements or changes.</em></p>
                            <p>Sometimes direct quotes have spelling or grammatical deviations from <init>SAE</init>. In order to preserve the original voice, it's important to include these deviations when possible and acknowledge them with an indicator ([sic], Latin for <q>thus</q>) after the perceived deviation. Similarly, if a part of your source material is underlined or italicized or in some other way emphasized, you should generally include this in your quotation. Emphases are indicated differently based on the citation style you are using (see <xref ref="citations"/>), but a basic guideline is to indicate emphases with <q>[emphasis in original]</q> at the end of or immediately following the quoted sentence. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-brackets-changes"/> for an example.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes sentences omit a previously referred<ndash/>to noun, person, or object to avoid unnecessary repetition, instead replacing the item with <q>it</q> or <q>they.</q> In order to specify the identity of the item, you can use brackets to identify it in place of or immediately after the pronoun. See <xref ref="example-punctuation-brackets-insertion"/> for an example.</p>

                <p>Apostrophes, or single quotation marks, most often mark possession. However, due to the inconsistent nature of English morphology, the task of marking possession is rather complicated.</p>

                <p>
                    Apostrophes are also used to mark contractions, or two words combined, such as <q>could</q> and <q>have,</q> which can be contracted, or shortened, to <q>could've.</q> A single apostrophe takes the place of omitted letters.
                </p>
                <example>
                    <title>Shortening Words with Apostrophes</title>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><q>Cannot</q> becomes <q>Can't</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>We would</q> becomes <q>We'd</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>It is</q> becomes <q>It's</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>Will not</q> becomes <q>Won't</q></p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><q>Won't</q> is an interesting case because its spelling does not correspond to its implied contraction <q>will not.</q> Linguists suspect that this is because, over time, the pronunciation of the contraction shifted such that <q>will</q> became <q>woll,</q> resulting in the current form <q>won't.</q> It should be noted that the above contractions constitute their own words without an apostrophe (cant, wed, its, and wont are all words). In order to avoid confusion, it is important to include the apostrophe in contractions.</p>
                </example>
                <p>Apostrophes can also come at the front of a word, such as <q>'Twas</q> to mark omitted letters (omitted from <q>'Twas</q> is the letter <q>I</q>: <q>It was</q>).</p>
                <p>Apostrophes can also be used in conjunction with single letters (such as grades), abbreviations, and numerals (including years). There are no standard rules for these usages. Ask your professor for their preference and be consistent. Aim for clarity where necessary. For instance, the plural form <q>As</q> (referring to the letter grade) will likely be misread as <q>As</q> the word. Use an apostrophe here (<q>A's</q>).</p>

                    <p>
                        Generally accepted usages:
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><q>Ph.D.s</q> becomes <q>Ph.D.'s</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>2010s</q> becomes <q>2010's</q></p></li>
                            <li><p><q>'10s</q> becomes <q>10's</q></p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </example>
                <note>
                    <p>Beware the personal pronouns <q>hers,</q> <q>yours,</q> <q>ours,</q> <q>its,</q> <q>theirs,</q> and <q>whose,</q> which do not use an apostrophe.</p>

                <p>
                    Knowing what to capitalize in titles can be incredibly confusing and frustrating. Different styles have their own policies, so consult the official stylebooks for the style in which you're writing. In general, when capitalizing, it is usually safe to capitalize:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>the title's first word</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><xref ref="definition-adjective">adjectives</xref>, <xref ref="definition-adverb">adverbs</xref>, <xref ref="definition-pronoun">pronouns</xref>, <xref ref="definition-noun">nouns</xref>, proper nouns, and <xref ref="definition-verb">verbs</xref> (except the <q>to</q> in infinitives).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    It is usually safe not to capitalize:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>articles (a, an, the)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><xref ref="definition-conjunction-coordinating">coordinating conjunctions</xref></p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>It is also fairly painless to find a capitalization automator online, which will capitalize your title according to the stylesheet you choose. (Google search <q>Capitalize my title.</q>)</p>

                    <p>Take Bob out of the picture completely (sorry, Bob). Would you say <q>She gave I the book</q> or <q>She gave me the book</q>? Right! You'd say <q>She gave me the book,</q> so you would say <q>She gave the book to Bob and me.</q></p>

                    <p>Does the period go inside the parentheses or outside of them?</p>
                    <p>
                        Is the parenthetical statement part of a sentence, or does the statement stand alone within parentheses?

                                <p>If it's part of a sentence, put the period outside the parentheses:</p>

                                <p>If it stands alone, put the period inside the parentheses:</p>

                    <p>Remember that there are differences between written and spoken language! Although you hear the word <q>of</q> when you say this, what you're actually saying is <q>ve</q><mdash/>the last half of <q>have.</q> Because the sounds are the same when spoken and therefore the meaning of the phrase is unobstructed, it's easy to forget the distinction while writing. But, since written language requires the distinction to retain the meaning of the sentence, writers instead use the contraction <q>could've.</q></p>

                    <p>Maybe just forget about this one. (Just kidding<mdash/>kind of.) Despite being such a wonderful thing, the act of lying (laying?) down can cause a world of pain when trying to write about it. The crucial thing you must determine is what (or who) is doing the laying/lying: (1) Is someone or something lying down on their own? (2) Or is someone laying something (or someone) else down?</p>

                    <p>This distinction is rapidly falling out of use, but a tip about how to remember the different usages might come in handy.</p>
                    <p>If you would say <q>him,</q> <q>her,</q> or <q>them,</q> then you should use whom. If you would say <q>he,</q> <q>she,</q> or <q>they,</q> then use who.</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Who's vs. Whose</p>
                    <p>Possessives in English are the worst! <q>Who's</q> seems like it would denote possession because it has an apostrophe, which is how we usually indicate that someone has something (with the exception of possessive pronouns like hers, his, theirs, and yours, of course<ellipsis/>). But, unfortunately, <q>who's</q> is a contraction of <q>who is</q> or <q>who has</q> and it has nothing to do with possession.</p>
                    <p>
                        <example>
                            <title>Who's Who?</title>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p><q>Who's that over there?</q> → <q>Who is that over there?</q></p></li>
                                    <li><p><q>She's the one who's been helping me.</q> → <q>She is the one who has been helping me.</q></p></li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </example>
                    </p>
                    <p><q>Whose,</q> on the other hand, indicates that someone, <q>who,</q> possesses something. If you're a fan of early 2000s American comedy, you might use <em>Whose Line is it Anyway?</em> as a mnemonic device.</p>
                    <p>
                        <example>
                            <title>Whose Mnemonic Device?</title>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p><q>Whose baby is that?</q> → <q>To whom does that baby belong?</q></p></li>
                                    <li><p><q>My friend, whose bike was stolen, decided to buy a U<ndash/>lock.</q> → <q>My friend, who possessed a bike that was stolen, decided to buy a U<ndash/>lock.</q></p></li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                <li>
                    <p>Speaking of possessive pronouns<ellipsis/></p>
                    <p>Similarly to <q>who's</q> looking like the possessive version of <q>who,</q> the possessive versions of the pronouns <q>it, him, her, your, their, and our</q> can be misleading. Although the apostrophe (it's, her's, your's, their's, and our's) is tempting to include, leave it out! The correct possessive pronouns are: its, his, hers, yours, theirs, and ours.</p>

                    <p>Where do commas and periods go when you're using quotation marks?</p>
                    <p>In <xref ref="SAE" text="title"/>, commas and periods go inside <q>quotation marks.</q> The exception to this guideline is for some citation styles, like MLA, which <q>look like this</q> (page number).</p>
