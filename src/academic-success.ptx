    <title>Strategies for Academic Success</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>By the time you're reading this, you've probably been at Puget Sound long enough to realize that college looked easier on paper than it has turned out to be. Taking <em>only</em> four classes at a time and <em>only</em> being in class twelve hours a week sounded great, but it sounded great because seeing college on paper didn't show you how much work you'd have to do outside of class, how many other activities you'd want to get involved in, and how much less structured your life would be than it was in high school. This freedom and independence is one of the things that makes college such an awesome experience and such a great chance to grow as a person, but it also takes some adapting to, and most graduating seniors could tell you a story off the top of their heads about how they didn't manage their time, got disorganized, or said something inappropriate to a professor or another student in the midst of some unforeseen college calamity.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it will feel like your life is falling apart around you. We don't know a single college student who hasn't had moments that were incredibly hard, emotionally as much as intellectually, in the course of their time at Puget Sound. Maybe assignments are late. Maybe a friend or family member has needed your help with life-stuff. Maybe your own personal health, mental or physical, is making school difficult. Maybe it's just been raining and grey outside for a week straight and you're tired of being cold and wet every time you leave your room. College is exciting in new, unique ways, but it's also difficult in new, unique ways. New challenges require new approaches, and though we can't say how to fix everything, chapter provides baseline suggestions for how to manage your time, stay organized, and talk to professors, <em>especially</em> when life gets hard.</p>

        <title>Talking to Professors</title>

        <title>The New Student-Teacher Relationship</title>
        <p>College is different from high school in lots of ways, but one of the most important changes that is easy to miss is in the relationship between you and your teachers. In high school, your teachers were proactive so that you could be reactive. This means that your teachers made sure that you knew what homework was due the next day, let you know when you hadn't turned in an assignment, and checked in when you missed class. They initiated action, and you just had to respond. In college, <em>you are expected to be proactive</em>, and your <em>professors will be reactive</em>. This means that if you don't understand course material, get behind on assignments, or miss class, it's up to you to turn in assignments on time, show up to class, and learn course material. This new freedom is a good chance to develop independence and run your own life, but it can also be dangerous if you're not aware of your new responsibility to take responsibility for your own learning and progress. </p>
        <p>You have a different set of responsibilities and roles as a college student than you did as a high school student, and college professors similarly have a different set of responsibilities and roles than your high school teachers did. Teaching high school is a demanding job, but high school teachers are primarily teachers, which is to say that 95% of their time at work is spent focused on students. College professors are expected to be good teachers, especially at a liberal arts school like the University of Puget Sound, but they are expected also to be scholars who create and publish new knowledge and committee members who help run the university. Finally, college professors work with adult students, and they don't want to treat students as incapable youth any more than students want to be treated as incapable youth.</p>

        <title>The Syllabus</title>

            <title>Your Secret Weapon</title>
            <p>We wanted to explain the parts of professors' lives that you probably haven't thought about because it's important context for understanding their many roles, their jobs as your teachers, and how you can relate to them respectfully and productively. That being said, professors are here to teach you and every other student in their class, and they want to do that to the best of their ability while balancing their other responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Making a request of a professor can be difficult, especially while you're still adapting to a new student-teacher dynamic, and oftentimes when a student says something disrespectful to a professor, or visa versa, it's because of a lack of thoughtfulness or understanding, not a willful malevolence. Fortunately, professors <em>give you</em> a secret weapon you can use when you need to make a request. It's called a syllabus. Most students don't recognize the power of the syllabus because syllabi in high school (if you even had them) tend not to be as informative as syllabi in college. In college, by contrast, there are many good reasons to read the syllabus.</p>
            <p>
                Reading the syllabus can tell you<nbsp/><ellipsis/>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>how your professor likes to be addressed.</p></li> 
                    <li><p>the best way to contact your professor.</p></li>
                    <li><p>the times that your professor offers office hours.</p></li>
                    <li><p>the professor's (or department's) policy on extensions and late work.</p></li>
                    <li><p>the professor's (or department's) policy on what constitutes cheating and what forms of collaboration are allowed.</p></li>
                    <li><p>how they will calculate your grade.</p></li>
                    <li><p>when assignments are due.</p></li>
                    <li><p>what materials you need for the course.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Now there's a magical day at the beginning of the semester called <q>syllabus day</q> where everyone goes to class and just does nothing! How amazing!</p>
            <insight>
                <p>Just kidding! The truth is, of course, that syllabus day is important. Professors reserve an entire day of class to go over the syllabus because they <em>expect</em> students to know their policies and assignment due dates.</p>

        <title>Making Requests</title>
        <p>Professors are amazing resources, which is why it can be so tempting to shoot off a quick email asking if they know of any good sources for your next paper or if they can send you notes for the day of class that you missed. But communicating with professors in a way that's respectful and effective requires that you think a little bit more about what you're asking for. One of the the best rules of thumb for interacting with professors is to do as much work ahead of time as you're about to ask the professor to do for you. If you still need help after taking the steps you should, explain to the professor what you've already done, and ask for something specific. This communicates that you've been proactive in meeting your needs and gives them a really specific action they can take to help you.</p>
        <example>
            <title>Contacting Your Professor After Missing Class</title>
            <p>For example, instead of this:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Hi professor, I was hoping you could send me your notes for the class I missed yesterday. Did we do anything important?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Try saying:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Hi professor, I met up with Shannon and got their notes from yesterday since I stayed home sick and missed class. They told me you announced our next paper and put the prompt on Moodle, but after looking over the prompt, I realized I'm not sure what it means to <q>reconstruct the author's argument <em>without</em> summarizing.</q> This seems like a really subtle distinction to me; do you mean I should use the same evidence as the author to make the same claim? How is it possible to reconstruct an argument without just saying what the article says? I know you don't have office hours tomorrow, but I'd like to get started as soon as possible since, as you know, I'll be away for soccer this weekend. I was hoping I could come by your office for 15 minutes tomorrow to get a clearer picture of what you're looking for. I'm free before 11 am and from 2<ndash/>3:30 pm.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </example>
           <warning>
            <title>Check Your Bias</title>
            <p>Most students feel more comfortable asking for extensions, favors, or help from <em>some</em> faculty members that they wouldn't ask for from <em>other</em> professors. One thing that might not cross your mind <em>but should</em> is why that is. It might be that you have great rapport with a professor you know well and you're sure that it'll be fine. But it's <em>also</em> possible that your professor's identity plays a role in what you think a professor will do for you because implicit bias affects all of our decisions if we're not careful. Academia operates within broader societal structures (not to mention the ones it creates in addition), and as such most of us are less likely to challenge the policy of professors who are male, white, older, or have been teaching a long time. These aren't the only identity factors that play a role in how you might see a professor, but they're worth considering. Think twice about how your professors' identities influence how you see their responsibility to you, and you can help dismantle the identity-based power structures in academia!</p>
        </warning>
        <p>It's impossible to write a guide on <q>how to ask any professor for anything in any context,</q> so rather than even attempting that, we'd like to leave off this section and preface the next section with a few tips that are true in any scenario.</p>

            <title>Strategies for Making Requests</title>

                        <p>Show the professor why they're the right person for you to go to next, and don't ask one professor for something that you wouldn't ask another professor for just because you think they're a pushover.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="asking-for-extension">
        <title>Asking for an Extension</title>
        <p>One of the most common interactions that you may have with a professor that can still be difficult to navigate is asking for an extension on an assignment. This is difficult for a few reasons, but mostly it's difficult because your perspective and the professor's perspective can differ so much, and understanding these differences can help you ask for what you need in a more thoughtful (and hopefully, successful) way. First of all, you could have lots of reasons for asking for an extension. Maybe there was a family emergency. Maybe you have a lot of other work to do the same day. Maybe you've been stuck in bed sick. Maybe you just didn't plan quite right and started too late. Often, asking for an extension is not planned, but happens as a panicked response to a scenario you didn't want to be in in the first place. Professors know that there are good reasons to ask for an extension, but they've also heard a lot of <em>not</em> good reasons for asking for an extension.</p>
        <p>What might feel catastrophic or unusual in your life is probably something that your professor has heard from another student before. They know that being a student is really tough and that life falls apart sometimes. Everyone gets sick and has to deal with emergencies sometimes. Getting an extension is often better than turning in a partially complete assignment, but when you ask for an extension, think about how what you say will come across to your professor. They've received too many emails that start with <q>Hey, I'm really really busy and I have a lot of work to do for my other classes, and I was hoping I could get an extension on your assignment.</q> They might believe and empathize with you, but because the assignment you're falling behind on has probably been on their syllabus the entire semester, they're just going to think that you planned poorly and now are asking them to accommodate that poor planning. So how should you ask?</p>
        <list xml:id="list-talking-strategies-extensions">
            <title>Strategies for Asking for an Extension</title>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Ask permission to turn in an assignment late rather than forgiveness for having already done so, and ask as far in advance as possible.</em></p>
                    <p>This proactive step gives you lots of time to work out a new arrangement with the professor and communicates to the professor that you are thinking ahead and have read their syllabus.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Think about who else your late work might affect.</em></p>
                    <p>Turning in late work will almost certainly require that your professor deal with it separately, but it may also impact other students if you ask to take a test or give a presentation on a different day.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Check the syllabus and know the professor's policy on late work and extensions, which can vary drastically by discipline and professor.</em></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>With the last point in mind, know whether you are asking for the professor to make an exception to their policy or not, and<nbsp/><ellipsis/></em></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>If you're asking the professor for something that's generally not allowed by their policy, give them an out by saying that you recognize that they might not be able to give you what you're asking for.</em></p>
                    <p>Giving the professor an easy way to reject you may sound counterproductive, but it really makes you seem more reasonable and understanding.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>If you know you can't get an assignment in on time but it's entirely your fault and you know it, be honest about it.</em></p>
                    <p>Like most people, professors respond far better to people who are being genuine than they do to people who come up with a flimsy reason for why they haven't been able to get something in on time.</p>

        <title>To Send or not to Send</title>
        <p>A large portion of the communication that you have with professors will be over email, which means that knowing how to write emails to professors is useful as a skill in itself and is transferable to talking with professors in-person.

    <p>Professors have different preferences and policies on what they consider respectful or acceptable communication, and often, it's easy to be familiar or informal with Puget Sound professors because they are approachable, kind, and often genuinely interested in knowing and talking with their students. Depending on the professor, being addressed informally or having a student ask them for an exception to a rule might not bother them at all; however, they're also professionals, which means that even if they are annoyed, they might not tell you. Nevertheless, if a student does something that they perceive as disrespectful many times, intentionally or otherwise, they may start to associate the student with negative interactions, which isn't good for anyone!</p>

<section xml:id="requesting-letter-of-rec">
    <title>Requesting Letters of Recommendation</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>At some point in your life, you’ll probably need to ask someone for a letter of recommendation. If you’re reading this handbook, you’re most likely a college student, so this section specifically addresses how to ask a professor for a letter of recommendation, but all of the big ideas in this section are true for asking a supervisor or a coworker for a letter of recommendation as well! For the rest of this section, <q>professor</q> means the person you’re asking for a letter of recommendation, and <q>program</q> is a catchall word for the many different things for which you might need a letter of recommendation.</p>

            <p>This section explains three perspectives you should consider when figuring out who to ask for a letter of recommendation and then gives a suggested timeline for when and how you should communicate with the professor(s) you would like to write you a letter.</p>
        </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="three-perspectives">
        <title>Three Intersecting Perspectives</title>
            <p> In true liberal arts fashion, this handbook recommends that you consider three distinct perspectives as you are going through the process of requesting letters of recommendation: your perspective, your evaluator’s perspective, and your professor’s perspective.
            </p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="your-perspective">
            <title>Your Perspective</title>
            <p>When you ask a professor for a letter of recommendation, you should have answers to the following questions:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Why am I interested in the program I’m applying for?</p></li>
                    <li><p>How do I think this program will help me with my plans for my future? </p></li>
                    <li><p>What do I want a professor to say about me?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Which professors have seen me overcome challenges, engage with course material, take on a leadership role, or do great research?</p></li>
                </ul>
            You’ll probably need to think about the answers to these questions as part of your application anyway, but you might not have realized that the answer to these questions affect who you should even consider asking for a letter of recommendation. Different faculty members work in different fields and will know you in different capacities. What you want to share about yourself with an application committee determines who you should ask to write about you.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="your-evaluators-perspective">
            <title>Your Evaluator's Perspective</title>
            <p>Now imagine that you are the person who runs the program that you are applying for.
                <ul>
                    <li><p>What qualities do you want to see in a successful applicant, and what experiences is it important that applicants have? </p></li>
                    <li><p>What institutional values do you have, and how will they affect which applicants you select?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Which people know your applicants well enough to honestly evaluate the qualities/skills/experiences that they have had? Which professors do you trust most to also understand your values?</p></li>
                    <li><p>How much do you care about letters of recommendation? Do you just want to know that a student is competent, or are you only interested in an applicant if they immensely impressed their professor?</p></li>
                </ul>
            Again, you might already know that you needed to think about these questions for your application, but notice that the answers to these questions also dictate which faculty members will have the most influence over the people deciding whether or not to consider your application favorably!</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <insight>
            <p> At this point, you might be inclined to say, <q>now how am I supposed to answer those questions? I can’t get inside the heads of the people on the application committee!</q> That’s true, but you can guess the answer to a lot of these questions by carefully reading the program’s website and by talking to to students, professors, or staff members who are familiar with the program.</p>
        </insight>

        <paragraphs xml:id="your-profs-perspective">
            <title> Your Professor's Perspective</title>
            <p>Finally, think about where your professor is coming from and what they might need to think about as they are considering whether they are willing to write you a letter and what they can say about you based on their personal interactions with you:</p>

            <p><ul>
                <li><p>Do I know my student well enough to write about them in detail? What can I say with honesty and integrity about this student?</p></li>
                <li><p>What qualities did I see my student exhibit? Was I impressed with these qualities?</p></li>
                <li><p>What do I know about the program that my student is applying for, and what qualities are the evaluators looking for in an applicant?</p></li>
                <li><p>What does my student want the application evaluators to know about them?</p></li>
                <li><p>Who will read my letter?</p></li>
                <li><p>How am I going to keep track of all of the letters that I agreed to write for various students?</p></li>
            </ul></p>
        </paragraphs>

        <p>Professors often write letters of recommendation to their peers and colleagues at other institutions. Their reputations are at stake when they recommend their students for other opportunities, so they take the integrity of the process seriously. This perspective should not make you panic, but it should encourage you to put yourself in your professor’s shoes and think about the things they have to consider when writing a letter of recommendation.</p>

        <p>If a professor is going to write you a great letter of recommendation, they need to see that you have the qualities that are important for what you are applying for. These could include perseverance through struggle, curiosity about a topic, clever approaches to problems, or any number of other things. The bottom line is that a letter of recommendation is a professor’s argument that you’re a good candidate for the thing you are applying for, and professors can best support this argument if they have a lot of specific evidence about why they think that is. Remember that helping a professor get to know you is not just about how much time you spend with them; it is about what you show them about yourself during that time.</p>
 
        <p>Ideally, your letter-writer is someone who has worked with you in multiple classes or advised you on an independent project and who can tell specific stories that exemplify the unique qualities that make you a good choice for your program of interest. For example, if you are applying for a summer research internship, you should ask for letters of recommendation from professors who have seen you do research. If you have not worked with anyone on an independent research project, faculty who have seen you do research projects in class might be a good option instead.</p>

       <title>Managing Time</title>
            <introduction>
            <p>Time management is a lot like juggling. In part, it's like juggling because keeping track of homework due dates, meeting times, and everything else you have going on in your life is inherently difficult; but it's also like juggling because the process itself is a perpetually active endeavor that requires constant attention and adjustments. Successful time management is a three step process. First, you have to <em>plan</em> your time well. Second, you have to <em>execute</em> your plan well. Finally, you have to pay attention to which parts of the plan weren't realistic, which parts of execution didn't go right, and how you can avoid a future mishap. This process is iterative and continuous, so you have to be thinking about how yesterday's plan went, executing today's plan, and creating tomorrow's plan all at the same time. Toss one ball, pass the second from one hand to the other, and catch the third ball. Do it over and over again. When someone makes a mistake juggling, they don't usually just drop one ball. Failing to do any one step is usually immediately followed by a failure to do <em>any</em> of the steps, and in this respect again it is like time management.</p>

            </sidebyside>
            <p>Before we get into strategies for planning time, it's worth pausing to talk about using time well, and in particular its worth talking about <em>why</em> we don't use our time well.  Time management requires effort and commitment, and having a reason to commit time and energy to the process makes it easier to create and stick to good habits, especially when they're difficult at first.  So let's talk about procrastination.</p></introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="time-management-procrastination">
        <title>Good Ol' Procrastination</title>
            <p>Probably the most common challenge that most students (and people) face in managing time is procrastination. Procrastination is often associated with laziness, but really it's more of a question of facing the fear of starting something. Starting something is especially hard (and therefore procrastination most likely) when the task is important to us or difficult to undertake. Harder still is when the task is vague or involves many steps. For this reason, we tend to procrastinate most on our most difficult, abstract tasks that have the greatest impact on our life. How irritating! We can have a huge weight hanging over us (like a research paper, take-home test, or class presentation), but rather than chip away at one of <em>those</em> projects, it's easier for us to do a well-defined reading for a class, finish a problem set, or simply stew in our misery, squandering our time on our favorite website or social media platform.</p>
            <p>The key thing to note about procrastination is that it results from not knowing how to approach the terrifying scale of an important, abstract project. Only at the last minute, when our mind accepts that we might fail a class if we don't start in on the project that's worth 20% of our grade, do we rally to rush through the assignment before its due. The <q>last-minuteness</q> of our work forces us to compromise and make decisions as we go, and most importantly, it means that if we do poorly on an assignment, <em>it's not because we lacked intelligence, knowledge, or skills,</em> it's because we waited until the last minute. Our decision-making capabilities, not our identity, is at stake.</p>
            <p>Putting our heart into a task (like homework) and then hearing from someone we look up to (like a professor) say that it's not very good can be an awful feeling, so we protect ourselves by simply not giving ourselves the time to put our heart into our work. This attitude is easy to adopt, especially when we get feedback like that we're just <q>not good at math</q> or <q>don't have a way with words</q> or <q>are lazy.</q> These labels are damaging because they send the message that we <em>are</em> failures rather than that we have failed to show our best work. College assignments will probably ask most of us to do things that demand that we use skills that we believe we lack; to avoid letting an assignment (or the grade we get on an assignment) be yet another permanent mark of our inferiority, we procrastinate so that we can attribute any undesirable outcome not to our own failings, but to our circumstances.</p>
            <p>This cycle is difficult to break, but one of the most important things to remember is that procrastination almost always diminishes the quality of our work.</p>
            <note>
                <p>This doesn't mean that as soon as we stop procrastinating, we sail through college with easy A's<mdash/>quite the contrary. Not procrastinating lets us focus on the thing we came to college to do: we can start improving our skills by giving ourselves time to produce a true rough draft, get help from peers or professors when we're stuck, and generally <em>learn from our assignments</em> rather than <em>fear what they will reveal about us</em>.</p>

        <title>Productive Procrastination</title>
            <p>Procrastination is especially easy when there's an easily accessible distraction we can use to put off work. Some of the most common distractions are social media, imageboard websites, phone or computer games, TV, and socializing. Sometimes, though, the tasks we perform to procrastinate <em>seem</em> important, and this is called <term>productive procrastination<idx>productive procrastination</idx></term>. Symptoms of productive procrastination include cleaning, doing less-intimidating homework, sending emails, or otherwise taking care of day-to-day tasks that are important but that are clearly not urgent. One way of assessing whether you're allocating your time well is to use a the flowchart below. If there's anything on your plate that falls into the top box, <em>do that first</em>. The hard part to remember is <em>to do the middle box after that</em>. The categorization into urgent and not urgent is useful, but the nature of time means that anything that's important and not urgent will soon be both important and urgent! Not procrastinating means taking care of stuff in the middle box whenever you can, especially <em>before</em> it moves into the top box. Thinking in terms of both importance and urgency is a good way to stay out of the trap of feeling productive by doing less important or less urgent work.</p>

        <title>Procrastination Versus Self-Care</title>
            <p>Good time management is a form of self-care because it makes it possible to balance activities and commitments that you care about without compromising your mental, physical, and emotional health. Because it's easy to associate <em>not</em> doing work with procrastination, it can be difficult to tell the difference between taking a necessary mental break and procrastinating. So what's the difference?</p>
            <paragraphs xml:id="par-procrast-vs-selfcare">
                <title>Distinguishing Procrastination from Self-Care</title>
                <p>Self-care is crucial; procrastination activities are not. It's the difference between getting enough sleep versus making time for a Netflix episode. If you're not making time for the baseline things you need to be healthy (physically, mentally, and emotionally), chances are the extra <q>fun</q> things you are creating time for aren't self-care, but procrastination.</p>
                <p>Each of us will have different ways of <q>recharging our batteries</q> but the point of self-care is that it <em>does</em> recharge and rejuvenate—procrastination sucks energy and leaves guilt. Check yourself: do you actually feel rejuvenated after your break, or do you feel worse about yourself than when you started?</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <p>Trying to do things that <q>recharge your batteries</q> rather than that leave you feeling guilty about your break is a good way to decide whether a non-work activity is an important break. If you're probably going to be in a better mental, physical, or emotional state to be productive after you take a break to do something, chances are it's self-care, not procrastination.</p>

                    <p><em>Figure out why you want to procrastinate.</em></p>
                    <p>Are you afraid? Uninterested in your topic? Do you not know where to start? Or do you just really want to catch up on your favorite TV show? (For ideas about how to address these problems, see <xref ref="what-to-do-when-you-get-stuck"/>)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Tell yourself that you'll work for five minutes.</em></p>
                    <p>That's it. It may sound crazy, but this is actually a really good way to lie to<mdash/>I mean, to <q>encourage</q><mdash/>yourself in order to get work done. Once you've begun working, your anxiety about starting (or your desire to Internet surf to avoid working) will hopefully diminish, and you will likely find yourself able to work for much longer than five minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Create your ideal work environment.</em></p>
                    <p>You're finally away from home, you have your own (<nbsp/><ellipsis/> shared) space, and you've instituted a moratorium on any type of cleaning or organizing. Although you might be living the cleaning-free dream (perhaps to the dismay of your roommate), consider throwing away some of those granola bar wrappers and taking your <acro>SUB</acro> dishes back to the <acro>SUB</acro> (seriously, take them back to the <acro>SUB</acro>). Having a clean working space might help you focus. If not, try studying in different places around campus until you find a space that you can work in. Depending on your noise-level and spatial preferences and the time of day (or night), you might try Diversions, the piano lounge, the rotunda, upstairs in the <acro>SUB</acro>, a study room in the basement or second floor of the library, empty classrooms in Thompson, study areas in Thompson/Harned, Oppenheimer (the cafe), the <init>CWLT</init>, common spaces in your residence hall, study spaces around Wyatt or Weyerhaeuser, or (if the weather is nice) even somewhere outside (hint: the courtyard outside Oppenheimer Cafe has outdoor outlets!). Your study preferences might be different for each of your classes, so experiment!</p>

                <li>
                    <p><em>List your tasks, and break them down into parts.</em></p>
                    <p>While pretending your work doesn't exist may seem like the ideal solution, we assure you that it is not. You can lay all of your books, folders, or syllabi on the ground or your bed and organize them by priority or amount of work. Alternatively, you can make a list with all of your classes and write out the week's assignments for each class. Once you've faced the harsh reality of all the work you have to do, take a breath! Now, split up each task into manageable parts. Have 100 pages of reading? Can you split it up into groups of 20 or 25? Have six math problems? Do them in sets of two or three. Have a ten-page paper to write? Try writing two pages a day. By splitting something into its components, you'll likely feel less overwhelmed and therefore less desperate to procrastinate.</p>

                    <p><em>Limit distractions.</em></p>
                    <p>This tip is probably the worst one. It can be really hard! But know that some time away from the non-research-related Internet (<eg/>, YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Buzzfeed<nbsp/><ellipsis/> ) isn't a bad thing. In fact, it might make rewarding yourself (after a chunk of study time, of course) with some Internet time even more satisfying. To reduce temptations, you can try various strategies:
                        <ul>
                            <li><p> Look up browser plug-ins or apps that restrict access to certain websites for periods of time.</p></li>
                            <li><p>See if your phone needs an update (it's hard to text when it's taking five minutes to restart!).</p></li>
                            <li><p>Put your phone on a <q>do not disturb</q> setting, or ask your friends not to bother you for a while; turn off notifications.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Go in a public place where you'd be embarrassed to be seen procrastinating for two hours.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Ask a friend to study with you, and keep each other accountable.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Make a schedule that requires you to work but rewards you with a break (for example, you might work diligently for fifty minutes and then reward yourself with a ten-minute YouTube video or ten minutes of a show on Netflix each hour<mdash/>just beware that you don't get too distracted during your breaks).</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>If you need to, try treating yourself like a small child.</em></p>
                    <p>You can try encouragements like, <q>I know you don't want to finish your essay, but you need to. Once you're done, you can go to The Cellar for some ice cream!</q> Alternatively, you can create consequences for yourself if you keep procrastinating on your task: <q>Well, [your name here], since you just spent ten minutes working and fifty minutes watching Netflix, you have to wait until tomorrow to watch the new <em>Game of Thrones</em> episode.</q></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Remind yourself of what you're excited about.</em></p>
                    <p>Sometimes we get so caught up in the tediousness of the work we have to do that we forget why we're here. Even if you're procrastinating on work for a class you don't enjoy, try to think about the bigger picture<mdash/>completing your assignment means that you're one step closer to fulfilling a requirement and moving on to classes you're more interested in. But hey, the assignment might also surprise you, and you might end up learning something that you find fascinating. You never know!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Forgive yourself.</em></p>
                    <p>Procrastination happens! Forgive yourself and move on. Don't let the fact that you've been procrastinating all day keep you from starting on your work.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Decrease the amount of work you have to begin with.</em></p>
                    <p>You'd be surprised at how much you can get done during the little chunks of time you have throughout the day, be it five minutes before class, an awkward hour in between classes, or extra time in the morning or before bed. Even if you can only read a couple of pages, write a paragraph, or finish a math problem during a small break, that's still less work you'll have to do later. Plan ahead and bring along any materials you might need to be as productive as possible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Make your breaks productive.</em></p>
                    <p>It’s hard to work when your brain is tired. Schedule in breaks that actually make you feel refreshed, like dinner with a friend, throwing a Frisbee on Todd Field for ten minutes, or half an episode of your favorite show. Keep yourself off Instagram by looking forward to the break instead. Getting up, socializing, or changing pace occasionally will make you feel more refreshed than mindlessly scrolling through Instagram when you’re struggling to piece words together. </p>

        <title>Good Time Management</title>
        <p>The root of time management is using time well, and using your time well requires understanding the time you have. Depending on how much you enjoy being organized already and how busy or unstructured your life is, you may already have a knack for figuring out what time of day you do your best work, when you have different amounts of free time, and a good sense of how long your work will take.</p> 
        <p>Understanding procrastination helps us identify strategies we can use to avoid it. In particular, breaking down an intimidating project early-on is an essential skill to have when approaching a daunting task. But how do you create good goals that will help you chip away at a big assignment? One way is to ensure that your goals are <alert>S</alert>pecific, <alert>M</alert>easurable, <alert>A</alert>ttainable, <alert>R</alert>elevant, and <alert>T</alert>ime-bound, or <acro>SMART</acro> for short. So if writing a lab-report is the intimidating project that you're procrastinating on, writing a goal like <q>write lab report</q> in your planner is not especially useful. It's not a sub-goal, and it doesn't give you something specific to work on, so it's far more likely to trigger the <q>aaaaaaaahhh that's so much to do</q> reaction that's likely to lead to procrastination.</p>
        <example>

        <p>Notice that some of the goals in the preceding examples aren't just about the goal itself; the last one, for example, addresses the environment in which you want to pursue your goal and what <q>anti-procrastination promises</q> you need to make to ensure that you can follow-through on your goal. If you break a large project into several goals that you can give yourself on several different days, you have to start far in advance of the due date, but you also <em>make progress far ahead of the due date</em> and have time to ask questions and improve your work as you go. You'll produce a better final product, and achieving small goals along the way feels good!</p>

    <subsection xml:id="time-chart">
        <title>Making and Using a Time Chart</title>
        <p>All right. Approach big problems with small goals. Great. But how do you then follow through on those smaller goals? As you start breaking down your bigger projects, you'll find the strategies that work well for you, and tweaking the strategies that we recommend here to be most effective for you is important! That being said, one of the most tried-and-true approaches to managing daily work is the <term>time chart<idx>time chart</idx></term>. The point of a time chart is to give you an action plan for each day. It accounts for where you have to be when, but it also includes what work you're going to do when. A time chart isn't a planner or a calendar, but making a good time chart requires that you have a good sense of both what you need to do on a given day and what your time commitments are on a given day, which planners and calendars, respectively, help you keep track of. Finally, time charts are useful because they force you to assign priority to the tasks you want to accomplish.</p>
        <p>So how should you use a time chart? As is the case with everything we've discussed in the academic consulting section, everyone develops slight variations on the underlying strategies for staying organized and managing time, but the steps we lay out here are a great way to start if you've never made a time chart before. Many people like to use a paper planner, which is what we present first, but there are great digital options for making a time chart as well, such as Google Calendar. First, take a look at the <init>CWLT</init> time chart below. If you like what you see here, you can pick up a time charts like this one at the <init>CWLT</init>.</p>
        <sidebyside width="50%">
                <image source="images/AS-timechart_sample"/>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>With your own time chart in hand, fill it out following the following guidelines.</p>
        <list xml:id="list-time-chart">
            <title>Strategies for Making a Time Chart</title>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Add all of your classes for the week.</em></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Add your other fixed commitments, which could include sports or music practices, work, exercise, meals, club meetings, and appointments with friends or professors.</em></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Look at the time that's left, and schedule in time to work on specific goals or assignments. Remember to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Be realistic about how long each task is going to take.</em></p>
                                <p>This will be easiest if you've briefly looked over assignments ahead of time to triage your workload. How long are each of those readings? How many problems are in the problem-set?</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Remember those <xref ref="time-management-good-time-management" text="title">sub-goals</xref>.</em></p>
                                <p>Better to give yourself 2 hours to write an outline for a paper than to give yourself 8 hours to write a paper.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Recognize that some time is <q>higher quality</q> than other time, and use it to do your highest-priority tasks.</em></p>
                                <p>Four hours of work during the time of day when you're most focused is probably a much better time to work on a challenging problem set than during a one hour break between difficult classes when you're also hungry.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Make time for review.</em></p>
                                <p>Your long-term memory will remember content best if you review it right as you start to forget what you've learned. Taking time at the end of the day to go over class notes and remember the highlights of what you learned is a great way to do high-quality review in a short amount of time.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Plan to plan.</em></p>
                                <p>Schedule a time in your time chart when you'll make a time chart for the <em>next</em> week. Time management and organization strategies are only useful if they're consistent!</p>

        </list>
        <p>If you're using a digital calendar (such as Google Calendar), the principles for setting up a time chart are the same as for a paper planner, but the digital platform offers a few features that are worth using as well.</p>
        <list xml:id="list-time-digital-calendar">
            <title>Strategies for Using a Digital Calendar</title>

                        <p><em>Set recurring events for the commitments that don't change week to week.</em></p>
                        <p>Using recurring events means that your school and work schedule (and maybe more) will show up every week without you having to write them down over and over.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>Take advantage of notifications.</em></p>
                        <p>If meetings or homework assignments have a tendency to slip your mind, you can always turn on notifications on your phone or computer to remind you before you're supposed to be meeting someone or working on something.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>Access your calendar/time chart from multiple platforms.</em></p>
                        <p>If you have a smartphone, you can access your calendar from your phone as well as from any computer, which makes adding new commitments as you learn about them much easier.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </list>
        <p>Whether you use a paper time chart or a digital time chart is up to you, and the simplest way to capture the difference between the two is that a digital time chart trades tangibility for convenience. Planning out your time for a week on paper, much like carrying around a paper planner, gives you something tangible to carry around, pull out after class, and fill out with pens and pencils. It makes your schedule feel more real, and the <em>process</em> required to upkeep a physical calendar keeps your mind engaged in your schedule. A digital calendar relieves you of the responsibility of filling out the same classes week after week and makes your calendar accessible from anywhere, but it does so at the cost of your physical interaction with your time chart, and this physical interaction is a good way to start forming the habits of mind involved in managing time. Plus it's a lot harder to doodle in the margins of your digital calendar!</p>

        <title>A Few Final Thoughts</title>
        <p>It's difficult to remember all the classes, office hours, athletic practices, club meetings, and social events of college. Even more difficult is remembering all the assignments, due-dates, and special club events, that go along with those responsibilities, let alone the relative priority that each item has. More than difficult, though, it's <em>stressful</em>. It detracts from your ability to focus on and enjoy the content of what you're learning when you have to spend mental energy constantly keeping track of what's the highest priority task you have to do next. The <q>weight</q> that comes from mentally juggling so many different tasks is even worse for projects that are large, important, and ambiguous. When you create a time chart and schedule time to do a specific task, you're effectively relieving yourself of one ball that you were juggling by giving the tasks specific time and place on your schedule.</p>

    <title>Getting Organized</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>There is a lot of digital and print material associated with all of the things you're juggling as a college student. As a student, of course you have lots of papers and books<mdash/>and their digital equivalents<mdash/>to keep track of. But you probably also have paper in other areas of your life. As an employee, you likely have tax forms. As a student living away from home or studying abroad, you will likely need to keep track of a passport and other travel-related documents. You probably also have papers associated with clubs and/or off-campus community activities. Keeping all the physical and digital materials in your life organized goes hand in hand with keeping your time organized because having the things you need readily accessible can make the difference between a task taking ten minutes or an hour (or even longer).</p>

                                    <p>This is something to look into right away, because in many classes you need to be reading from the textbook before each class. In other classes that require you to read a variety of smaller texts, you generally don't need them all at once. So check your syllabus and prioritize the ones you will be using in the first few weeks of classes, and make a list on your planner for the books you still need to get.</p>

                                    <p>This way, if you run into problems, you have time to solve the problem or go to Tech Services before any assignments requiring the application are due.</p>

                                    <p>That way, you can access them without WiFi and don't have to worry about a long line at the printer when you want to grab a reading in a hurry.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                        <p><em>Designate a place to keep track of materials for each class.</em></p>
                        <p>The system that works best for you will depend somewhat on your classes and your personal preferences, but the basic idea is that you will be working with a lot of paper and digital resources for all of your classes. It's helpful if you use the same basic organizational structure for your digital documents as for your paper documents. A computer is required for lots of assignments in college, and pretty soon documents and readings will start piling in distant folders. Soon, you may find that you can also access some documents after typing approximately twenty different search words in the <q>search my computer</q> bar, until they pop up in a Documents folder within a Documents folder within a Miscellaneous folder. Don't let this happen! Instead, make folders with the name of each class on your personal computer desktop, Google Docs, or your school desktop. This is where the materials for each class will live. Here are some specifics on different kinds of materials you'll have:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Notes.</em> For nearly all classes, you'll be keeping notes on paper. If your classes require a lot of lecture notes, a notebook for each class works well. If you have classes that are always on the same day, it can be a good option to have a two- or three-subject notebook for those classes.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Readings</em>. If your class uses a collection of various readings, that can lead to a lot of papers floating around! Unless lifting a giant backpack is part of your weight-training plan, you will probably not want to bring everything from the whole semester to class every day and you will likely want to have a folder for the week's printed paper readings and a binder in your room where you store readings from earlier and later weeks in the semester.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>If your readings are printed out, you will probably find it easiest to organize your stored readings chronologically by week (so, the readings progress from the beginning to the end of the semester, right there in your binder).</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>If your readings are electronic, you may want to rename the files so that they're easy for you to find<mdash/>you might want to name them by the author's last name, or you may want to name them by the date on which you're reading them<mdash/>or by both the author name and the date.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><em>Assignments.</em> You may receive a paper copy of assignments in class, but it's helpful also to download each assignment from Moodle/Canvas and add it to the digital folder corresponding to that class.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Collect contact information from at least one person in each class.</em></p>
                    <p>Everyone ends up suffering from the Puget Plague at one point or another, but it doesn't have to make you fall behind in classes. Your week will be a lot easier if you can get the notes and new assignments from a classmate the day of, rather than having to wait until you're recovered to set up a time to meet with your professor. This also gives you a go-to person to study with when exams and papers start coming up.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Designate a study space that you will always have available.</em></p>
                    <p>This may take a week or two to figure out, but it is really helpful to have at least one place that is accessible and where you can always work, free of clutter. This could be your desk in your room, but that desk always has to have space to work. So if you don't think you can maintain that or if you keep a lot on your desk, maybe it's the library or your resource room in Thompson. Just find a place that you can always (or almost always) access, where you are able to get into a productive study <q>zone.</q></p>

                    <p><em>Update your planner, every day.</em></p>
                     <p>As the semester goes on, keep updating your planner in the daily section when assignments come up. Also add non-academic things to your planner that you need to be sure not to forget. Think doctor appointments, work meetings, and club meetings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Secure all the resources you need for each week.</em></p>
                    <p>This principle will apply most to classes involving a variety of materials, rather than one main textbook. If your class has frequent readings, download all the readings you will need for that week. Put them in your desktop folder for that class. If you'll be reading a new book next week, make sure you have it and switch out your materials. Friday is probably the best day to get everything together quickly for the next week. If you're planning to check out for part of the weekend, once you are back in school mode, your assignments will be ready for you to tackle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Bring the right materials to each class by planning the day before.</em></p>
                    <p>Each night, make sure you have the folder and the notebook/binder for each class the next day.</p>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <p><em>Keep your technology updated, and <em>back up your files.</em></em></p>
                    <p>This important step is often overlooked or put off, but it's easy to do and helps avoid a student's worst nightmare: your computer crashes right before a major paper is due, when you lose the file and have to beg your professor for an extension and wallow as you contemplate whether technology is destroying society. This means a lot of stress for you, and your professor is likely to see this kind of predicament as a poor planning problem rather than a technology problem. So, with better planning, you can avoid this!</p>
                    <p>There are lots of cloud-based options for storage (iCloud, GoogleDrive, Dropbox, OneDrive<mdash/>as well as your own personal Puget Sound account at <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/about/offices-services/technology-services/help-support/student-technology-resources/network-storage/">vDesk</url>. Even if your computer crashes or gets stolen, you can still access your documents in the cloud.</p> 
                    <p>You could also back up to an external hard drive. If these things are still confusing, just go to Tech Services and ask for help! They will be happy to restore you with a sense of academic calm.</p>

                    <p>At the end of each semester, make a new folder and place all the classes from the past semester there, so you can access them again if you need to but so that they don't clutter up your day-to-day life. Label this folder something obvious, like Spring 2018 Courses, or <init>UPS</init> Semester 1. Here's an example:</p>

        <title>School Meets Life</title>
        <p>A lot of what you'll be doing in college revolves around school, but there are lots of other parts of your life where keeping organized will make everything more relaxed and productive. Here are a few tips.</p>
        
        <list xml:id="list-organizing-email">
            <title>Strategies for Organizing Email</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>Once you start college, you'll likely have at least two email addresses: your personal one and your Puget Sound account, and having multiple accounts means that it's helpful to have a plan for keeping on top of those new demands.</p>
            </introduction>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Decide how you want to use your different accounts<mdash/>there are different approaches.</em></p>
                    <p>Some people prefer to keep things strictly school vs. personal, and that makes it easier when you graduate and don't use your Puget Sound account any more. Some people like everything being mixed together, because that makes it easier to just check one account. Regardless of your strategy, you'll need to check your Puget Sound email, since you'll get emails from professors and from the school there.</p>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <p><em>Don't keep thousands of unread messages in your inbox.</em></p>
                    <p>If this is already the state of your email, clear/mark as read your unread messages. Before you do this, make sure there are no important unread messages, because it's easy to forget about them once they're marked <q>read.</q> It's different for each type of email, but a quick online search will get you step-by-step instructions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Check your email at least once a day while you're enrolled in classes and at least every few days during other times if you're expecting contact from anyone.</em></p>
                    <p>During the school week, it's helpful to check at least once in the morning and once in the evening, as professors will generally inform you about assignments or changes to the syllabus via email. If your morning class is canceled, you don't want to miss the chance to sleep in because you didn't check your email!</p>

        <list xml:id="list-organizing-files">
            <title>Strategies for Organizing Digital Files</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>Part of being an adult is learning how to deal with all of the important papers that will come your way<mdash/>and all the important papers you'll need to hang on to for when you want to get a job after graduation. Think about what documents are in your life and divide them into categories, so you can always access something if you need it.</p>
            </introduction>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Keep track of potential <em>career information.</em></em></p>
                    <p>Keep a running list of the places you've worked, the dates you worked there, and your supervisors' names and contact info<mdash/>along with the more polished versions of this information (resumes, cover letters for past applications, personal statements). This folder is likely to expand and may need to have more sections within it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Keep track of <em>medical and financial information.</em></em></p>
                    <p>Organize forms you need for taxes, scholarship information, really anything having to do with money or your health.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Keep track of <em>miscellaneous activities</em> you've participated in.</em></p>
                    <p>Toss programs and other evidence from things you've done in college into a folder so that you can reference them later on. Being in clubs and sports and music and plays and organizations in college is fun, but it also helps you develop skills that are helpful later on. Who knows? Maybe it'll be useful to say in a job application that you have rehearsed and performed in 43 orchestral pieces or that you managed $3700 in <acro>ASUPS</acro> club funds. You never know what you might want to use as evidence later on in a job application, but you definitely can't reference something you can't remember!</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <conclusion>
                <p>Then, do the same with your physical documents. If you don't want to hang on to the paper copy, you can scan things for free at Collins Library's scanners. Your filing system doesn't have to be anything overly complicated. Label the files with the same names as on your computer and add any additional categories you need.</p>
